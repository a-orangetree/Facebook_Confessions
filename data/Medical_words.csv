i'm
so
happy
i'm
not
pregnant
stopped
using
condoms
and
i'm
not
on
any
birth
control
and
i
still
got
my
period
never
knew
pulling
out
could
be
effective
thoughts
i'm
hesitant
to
want
to
start
birth
control
because
i
don't
want
it
to
change
anything
about
my
body
i.e
weight
gain
or
loss
hormones
skin
changes
change
in
boob
size
are
there
any
other
diabetics
on
campus
whose
meter
i
can
use
my
insurance
company
isn't
letting
me
get
more
test
strips
right
now
and
i'm
out
are
there
any
athletic
sports
fitness
movement
based
clubs
i
could
join
with
little
experience
and
chronic
illness
fatigue
problems
if
you
think
canada
has
a
better
healthcare
system
why
do
people
in
canada
suffer
from
measles
mumps
dysentery
diphtheria
tuberculosis
those
are
diseases
not
common
in
the
u.s
am
i
the
only
one
here
who
cannot
stomach
the
thought
of
a
completely
innocent
unborn
child
paying
for
sins
that
are
not
their
own
how
can
people
say
a
fetus
is
not
a
child
at
20
weeks
a
fetus
can
feel
pain
and
can
hear
their
mothers
voice
i
understand
women
have
a
right
to
their
body
but
it's
so
completely
selfish
to
snuff
out
a
life
before
he
she
has
a
chance
to
even
live
i
just
have
a
couple
of
questions
on
the
abortion
is
only
okay
in
cases
of
rape
incest
and
if
it
endangers
the
health
of
the
mother
opinion
we
already
know
rapists
walk
free
such
is
our
legal
system
that
is
a
whole
different
topic
if
this
type
of
abortion
law
existed
could
you
imagine
the
horror
of
a
woman
having
to
carry
her
rapist's
child
because
a
jury
judge
decided
that
it
wasn't
rape
incest
is
fairly
easy
to
prove
i
guess
but
as
far
as
endangering
the
health
of
the
mother
what
would
the
line
be
many
cases
are
different
and
should
a
woman
have
to
carry
to
term
even
if
it
means
there
is
a
very
small
chance
she
won't
make
it
also
think
about
all
the
woman
and
i
know
this
sounds
really
bad
who
will
take
advantage
of
this
and
cry
rape
even
if
it
was
100
consensual
to
try
and
get
an
abortion
maybe
the
that
last
statement
about
crying
rape
is
not
a
good
argument
but
regardless
i
think
it's
a
good
idea
in
theory
but
that
it
could
never
work
ladies
ladies
your
troubles
have
ended
a
las
the
cure
suffer
from
uti's
on
a
pretty
regular
basis
hate
antibiotics
because
they
are
terrible
and
don't
let
you
have
fun
well
the
answer
is
simple
it's
called
d
mannose
haven't
heard
of
it
really
it's
simple
it
is
the
concentrated
form
of
the
active
ingredient
in
wait
for
it
cranberries
except
this
actually
cures
it
doesn't
just
treat
the
symptoms
it's
a
miracle
omg
i
sound
like
a
spam
ad
where
you
ask
where
can
can
you
find
it
the
answer
your
nearest
whole
foods
for
only
20
and
it's
totally
organic
and
natural
and
vegetarian
and
ahhh
it
feels
so
good
to
pee
warning
do
not
even
try
to
reply
to
this
with
some
condescending
medical
comment
you
know
nothing
jon
snow
i'm
3
weeks
pregnant
and
i
don't
know
how
to
tell
my
family
without
them
freaking
the
fuck
out
on
top
of
that
i
haven't
even
told
the
father
who
is
my
best
friend's
boyfriend
advice
a
vasectomy's
a
medical
procedure
one
that
makes
you
half
a
man
you're
half
a
man
remember
when
you
twisted
up
your
garden
hose
well
essentially
that
is
the
plan
you
make
a
small
incision
in
the
scrotal
skin
isolate
the
vas
and
then
you
hold
in
position
with
a
towel
clamp
then
you
snip
the
fibrous
tissue
hey
but
you'll
never
have
to
wear
a
condom
when
you
do
it
with
your
wife
or
anyone
else
you
do
it
with
we
promise
not
to
tell
like
that
new
hot
chick
at
work
you
know
the
one
who
always
has
high
beams
under
here
ribbed
white
cotton
t
shirt
then
stares
daggers
at
you
for
checking
her
out
and
it's
like
why
do
you
wear
that
if
you
don't
want
the
attention
buy
you
know
you
shouldn't
think
that
way
because
of
the
sexual
harassment
meeting
you
all
had
to
go
to
seriously
how
lame
was
that
and
you
couldn't
help
but
notice
that
the
female
lawyer
running
the
seminar
had
a
huge
rack
like
ridiculously
huge
for
someone
who
has
to
talk
about
that
kind
of
stuff
well
i
guess
that's
the
definition
of
the
word
irony
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
manhood
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
babies
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
kids
like
meg
vacuum
out
your
sack

pee

family

cream

f
ck

of
a
horse

torso
at
a
90
degree
angle
to
the
rest
of
my
body
and
whenever
i
bring
home
a
girl
she
usually
pukes
cries
and
runs
out
the
room
because
it's
so
big
i
think
most
girls
actually
think
i'm
a
monster
even
when
it's
flaccid
i
usually
have
to
tie
it
with
a
piece
of
thread
to
my
stomach
but
sometimes
the
thread
breaks
and
it
flops
around
in
my
pants
like
some
sort
of
wild
trout
out
of
the
water
i
really
don't
know
what
to
do
please
are
there
any
doctors
who
specialize
in
this
sort
of
shit
i
mean
it's
actually
like
16
inches

getting
another
boner
shit
admin
please
don't
delete
this
post
it's
a
serious
and
legitimate
medical
condition
i'm
only
resorting
to
cornell
confessions
because
i'm
so
embarrassed
to
go
anywhere
else
for
help
i
had
an
abortion
and
though
i
know
most
people
are
against
it
i
know
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
for
me
selfish
yes
the
guy
left
me
when
he
found
out
i
still
had
a
lot
of
school
to
finish
up
i
am
not
heartless
i
live
with
my
choice
everyday
but
i
do
not
regret
it
to
the
girl
who
said
she's
possibly
pregnant
and
thinking
about
an
abortion
lay
out
a
list
of
pros
and
cons
and
truly
think
about
your
decision
it's
not
an
easy
process
it's
painful
psychically
but
even
more
mentally
there
are
more
people
than
you
think
who
have
gotten
an
abortion
than
you
think
to
those
who
judge
me
you
may
call
me
a
slut
whore
bad
person
you
don't
know
it
until
you
have
been
through
it
contraception
isn't
always
100
effective

there's
been
a
lot
of
abortion
talk
on
her
lately
and
i
just
wanna
say
that
once
i
started
asking
around
it
turned
out
like
more
than
half
of
everyone
i
know
had
an
abortion
i
had
one
too
i
think
if
we
all
started
talking
about
it
they
wouldn't
feel
so
shameful
i
felt
really
ashamed
for
like
two
years
i
would
cry
whenever
i
thought
about
it
it's
hard
also
to
tell
people
about
it
because
they
have
no
idea
what
the
situation
was
and
you
don't
know
if
they're
going
to
be
okay
with
it
or
if
they'll
secretly
think
you're
some
kind
of
monster
that's
the
worst
part
not
knowing
if
people
will
hate
you
or
not
or
if
you're
going
to
be
unsafe
around
them
because
they
seriously
think
you're
a
baby
killer
or
something
can
we
all
please
come
out
of
the
closet
at
least
post
on
here
where
it's
anonymous
strength
in
numbers
me
and
my
boyfriend
haven't
been
together
for
even
a
month
and
i
might
be
pregnant
what
should
we
do
would
anybody
be
interested
in
a
group
for
survivors
of
serious
illness
injury
surgery
14269
it
makes
me
uncomfortable
to
hear
about
abortions
occurring
past
24
weeks
into
a
pregnancy
my
aunt
died
in
a
car
crash
when
she
was
24
weeks
into
her
pregnancy
and
her
baby
girl
was
removed
surgically
my
cousin
is
alive
and
well
today
with
no
disabilities
or
long
term
medical
problems
resulting
from
her
premature
birth
if
a
baby
is
capable
of
surviving
without
its
mother
at
that
time
shouldn't
he
she
have
the
right
to
live
even
if
the
mother
no
longer
wishes
to
carry
it
1358
i
think
cancer
is
a
bad
thing
i
don't
like
relay
for
life
what
does
it
say
about
our
view
of
humanity
when
we
rally
the
campus
for
chronic
disease
while
we
do
next
to
nothing
about
truly
horrific
human
crises
and
extreme
poverty
none
of
us
actually
care
about
human
beings
once
upon
a
time
i
was
cruising
down
from
the
top
of
main
street
above
the
whitt
intersection
like
i
normally
do
with
a
green
light
ahead
and
i
thought
i'd
pump
thru
it
alongside
the
cars
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
light
turned
red
and
i
quickly
found
myself
going
too
fast
to
pull
a
foot
stop
the
first
car
that
was
slowly
pulling
left
and
out
into
the
intersection
saw
me
and
peeled
out
so
i
could
make
it
through
before
more
traffic
clogged
it
up
right
behind
it
was
a
gables
bus
that
decided
to
slow
to
a
crawl
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
and
watch
me
try
to
unsuccessful
bang
a
hard
emergency
right
hander
onto
college
rd
there
wasn't
enough
room
and
i
ended
up
connecting
full
on
with
the
nose
while
the
driver
and
bus
completely
full
with
passengers
looked
on
my
board
shot
under
the
bus
and
over
onto
the
lawn
in
front
of
morrill
and
i
became
a
human
luge
for
a
split
second
i
had
to
push
myself
away
from
the
front
left
wheel
as
it
stopped
right
in
my
face
i
got
up
and
out
from
under
it
brushed
myself
off
the
bus
driver
opened
the
door
and
told
me
to
get
on
and
give
him
my
name
and
number
and
that
the
bus
company
would
be
calling
me
most
of
the
girls
on
the
bus
were
legitimately
terrified
and
asked
the
rest
of
the
bus
what
happened
the
guys
on
the
bus
just
replied
with
he
just
got
f
ed
up
for
some
reason
i
tried
to
give
everyone
a
smile
which
just
came
out
awkward
anyway
got
off
the
bus
and
proceeded
to
skate
off
to
murkland
for
class
everyone
on
both
the
right
and
left
sidewalks
still
in
awe
of
what
they
had
seen
watched
me
skate
away
sat
down
next
to
my
buddy
in
class
and
he
asked
me
what's
good
i
said
just
got
hit
by
a
bus
he
said
that
happened
to
me
once
did
a
superman
right
into
the
side
of
one
you
gonna
get
free
tuition
i
laughingly
replied
with
well
it
was
kinda
the
other
way
around
yeah
i
could've
lied
and
gotten
free
tuition
but
then
i
thought
mmm
bettah
not
other
than
a
frayed
outline
on
my
pants
in
the
shape
of
my
cell
phone
bruises
on
my
side
in
the
shape
of
the
rivets
from
the
bus
siding
a
few
cuts
and
a
slightly
bruised
mentality
about
how
well
i
can
cut
emergency
hard
right
hand
turns
on
my
longboard
i
wasn't
going
to
be
a
dick
and
get
that
kid
fired
from
a
sweet
campus
job
besides
i've
decided
that
sticking
to
late
night
cruising
all
over
campus
without
much
traffic
is
way
more
fun
than
being
on
the
pilot
show
for
i
shouldn't
be
alive
unh
edition
we're
too
concerned
about
sex
and
relationships
when
we
should
be
worrying
about
how
the
hell
we're
going
to
lice
5
10
even
20
years
from
now
where
are
the
people
who
are
focused
on
their
future
first
and
that
moment
of
satisfaction
later
excuse
me
for
changing
things
up
but
shit
orgasms
come
and
go
but
herpes
and
bills
are
forever
9236
is
okay
to
use
the
morning
after
pill
twice
like
if
i
took
one
2
years
ago
and
now
i
need
to
take
one
again
1944
no
i'm
not
on
a
diet
and
it's
not
totally
awesome
that
i'm
so
thin
i
have
an
illness
called
crohn's
disease
that
keeps
me
from
digesting
food
normally
it
is
not
fun
and
it
gets
worse
every
year
i'm
self
conscious
about
my
weight
and
my
food
because
it
means
i'm
sick
you
saying
you're
envious
of
my
willpower
is
just
dumb
and
makes
me
feel
weird
just
because
i'm
thin
doesn't
make
it
polite
to
focus
so
hard
on
what
my
body
looks
like
just
talk
to
me
about
drama
or
joss
whedon
or
cute
cats
k
i
had
an
abortion
9
months
ago
and
i
felt
secure
in
the
decision
at
the
time
i
mean
it
was
with
a
fleeting
hookup
who
was
second
best
to
someone
else
at
the
time
since
the
abortion
i've
fallen
in
love
with
that
person
i
feel
empty
and
frustrated
it's
hard
to
get
out
of
bed
it's
hard
to
go
to
sleep
am
i
mourning
the
loss
of
my
unborn
child
or
the
relationship
that
i
should
have
allowed
to
blossom
i
ended
that
the
real
question
is
what
do
i
do
about
it
now
my
insomnia
is
ruining
my
life
and
i
mean
it
when
i
say
insomnia
a
lot
of
people
use
it
to
mean
they
stay
up
until
3
00
am
watching
netflix
every
night
but
i
mean
that
i
literally
cannot
fall
asleep
at
all
during
the
night
sometimes
multiple
nights
in
a
row
it's
giving
me
health
problems
and
making
me
too
exhausted
to
do
anything
or
care
about
anything
i
know
there
must
be
some
people
who
are
going
through
or
have
gone
through
the
same
thing
what
do
i
do
how
can
i
make
it
better
i've
tried
things
like
meditation
breathing
relaxation
as
well
as
sleeping
pills
but
nothing
has
consistently
worked
and
no
smoking
pot
does

i'm
starting
to
feel
the
tolls
of
being
a
flickering
apparition
not
whole
just
constantly
fading
in
and
out
i
used
to
just
smoke
weed
hashoil
for
recreation
sporadically
now
i
smoke
for
self
medication
constantly
i
read
a
letter
today
from
the
strangers
project
about
a
man
dealing
with
the
pain
of
having
a
wife
go
through
a
miscarriage
and
i
broke
down
couldn't
help
it
i'm
only
21
and
thought
i
had
a
positively
bright
future
ahead
of
me
i
found
the
perfect
woman
and
then
chaos
found
us
and
killed
a
part
of
us
what
is
this
memory
going
to
mean
to
me
20
years
from
now
will
it
haunt
me
as
it
does
now
what
will
i
mean
to
her
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
told
me
that
there
was
a
time
when
she
wanted
to
marry
me
and
i've
wanted
to
marry
her
since
our
4th
date
2
years
ago
but
now
she
feels
we're
incompatible
and
she
needs
someone
older
and
more
mature
but
the
subtext
was
clear
she
can't
see
me
without
thinking
about
it
i
can't
think
about
classes
but
i
know
i
must
i
am
sad
and
angry
at
my
inability
to
do
anything
anymore
how
do
people
move
on
i'm
a
pregnant
my
boyfriend
doesn't
wanna
keep
the
child
but
i
want
to
should
i
be
proud
as
a
sophomore
girl
for
becoming
pregnant
should
i
keep
the
child
in
which
case
i'd
have
to
ditch
my
bf
and
become
a
single
mother
or
abort
it
also
are
babies
allowed
into
the
classrooms
in
case
i
decide
to
keep
the
baby
to
the
person
who
literally
has
adhd
oh
you
do
you
and
everyone
else
who
grew
up
overstimulated
by
media
perhaps
you
haven't
considered
that
these
kids
feel
like
they
need
add
medication
because
they
have
undiagnosed
add
if
i
tried
to
get
a
prescription
i
could
in
a
second
but
i
couldn't
afford
it
believe
it
or
not
being
able
to
afford
the
medications
you
need
is
a
privilege
if
you
don't
want
to
give
people
adderall
great
don't
but
you're
not
a
doctor
so
stop
preaching
about
how
you
truly
need
speed
to
function
when
you
don't
know
shit
about
someone
else's
situation
im
a
terminally
ill
single
woman
with
divorced
parents
and
yet
i
still
try
to
be
nice
to
everyone
i
see
whats
your
excuse
14298
i
hate
this
whole
abortion
debate
people
who
are
against
abortions
don't
get
abortions
people
who
want
them
get
it
either
way
someone
else
having
an
abortion
isn't
going
to
affect
your
life
in
any
significant
manner
so
stop
telling
other
people
what
to
do
and
mind
your
own
business
i
swear
globalization
and
social
media
has
given
people
the
false
impression
that
some
people
can
decide
how
other
people
should
live
their
lives
just
mind
your
own
fucking
business
can't
we
all
just
be
happy
with
that
you
can
have
your
abortion
and
i
don't
need
to
know
about
it
problem
solved
and
everybody
is
happy
let's
move
on
in
the
world
does
anyone
know
if
you
can
get
checked
for
stds
at
beutel
and
is
it
expensive
what
if
goofy
is
normal
in
his
world
and
pluto
is
his
down
syndromed
brother
that
he
hates
with
a
passion
so
he
treats
him
like
an
animal
