nyu
bursar
abruptly
dropped
me
from
spring
14
classes
because
of
my
sponsor's
delay
to
remit
my
past
due
balance
this
happened
due
to
circumstances
in
my
family
beyond
my
control
despite
the
entreaty
for
time
to
pay
up
the
funds
including
written
commitment
to
pay
from
my
sponsor
i
was
denied
fair
consideration
i
was
in
my
third
semester
as
an
international
student
with
just
thesis
left
before
graduation
i
was
told
by
nyu
student
counselors
that
nyu
is
a
business
and
the
students
are
customers
seriously
of
course
it
is
understood
that
there
are
running
costs
my
program
administrator
also
said
we
do
not
have
a
pool
of
money
here
waiting
for
international
students
to
take
advantage
of
i
wanted
to
be
silent
about
this
because
i
am
considered
a
minority
but
i
feel
like
not
being
heard
is
no
reason
to
remain
in
silence
because
there
might
be
someone
in
my
shoes
out
there
there
could
be
a
great
lesson
here
as
to
the
question
is
nyu
primarily
an
academic
institution
established
to
impart
knowledge
or
to
amass
wealth
without
due
consideration
11692
why
don't
people
get
that
college
was
founded
originally
so
that
lazy
rich
people
didn't
have
to
go
work
on
their
families
farms
like
children
from
lower
income
families
were
forced
to
it's
not
that
people
are
starting
to
buy
their
way
into
the
ivy's
now
it's
that
a
few
people
are
starting
to
get
in
through
merit
don't
be
so
surprised
by
how
stupid
the
majority
of
your
ivy
league
classmates
are
4507
it's
really
hard
and
annoying
to
go
to
a
restaurant
with
someone
who's
too
fucking
cheap
to
spend
and
tip
she
posts
pictures
on
instagram
about
all
these
nice
and
fancy
expensive
places
she
goes
to
eat
but
when
we
go
out
she
starts
getting
cheap
all
of
the
girls
in
the
group
always
takes
turns
getting
the
check
except
for
her
i
don't
kno
what
to
do
with
her
anymore
i'm
not
about
the
life
of
fast
food
restaurants
for
dinner
either
but
how
do
i
tell
her
to
stop
being
so
fucking
cheap

am
i
the
only
one
who
finds
this
beyond
fucked
up
4488
every
time
nyu
sends
me
a
bursar
email
saying
your
financial
aid
has
been
revised
i
get
an
anxiety
attack
this
is
really
not
good
for
my
blood
pressure
can
i
sue
for
unnecessary
distress
677
wow
these
posts
are
incredibly
pathetic
it
is
sad
that
there
are
people
here
who
don't
know
and
can't
even
comprehend
what
real
adversity
is
who
the
hell
tries
to
kill
themselves
because
of
a
prelim
grade
who
the
hell
gets
depressed
so
easily
just
because
a
guy
doesn't
like
them
grow
up
want
to
know
what
real
adversity
is
my
parents
abandoned
me
before
i
was
born
so
i
became
an
orphan
i
grew
up
living
in
a
household
with
a
total
income
of
below
10k
well
below
the
poverty
line
and
routinely
had
no
heat
in
the
winter
and
no
ac
in
the
summer
guess
what
i
didn't
cry
or
pout
or
get
depressed
i
worked
my
ass
off
and
got
into
cornell
i
don't
drink
go
to
parties
or
do
anything
that
could
jeopardize
my
future
cornell
gave
me
freedom
to
do
as
a
please
learn
what
i
want
and
to
not
have
to
worry
if
i
was
going
to
have
food
to
eat
that
night
cornell
is
an
amazing
place
and
most
of
you
people
don't
understand
how
valuable
the
name
and
education
is
you
should
be
thanking
yourself
that
you
got
into
such
a
great
university
now
go
back
and
evaluate
your
life
how
pathetic
do
your
stupid
first
world
problems
sound
now
you're
not
fending
for
your
life
in
the
middle
east
you're
not
worrying
about
what
to
eat
at
night
you
have
heat
you
have
a
place
to
live
i
didn't
have
most
of
those
things
growing
up
and
i
never
complained
in
conclusion
grow
the
fuck
up
study
harder
get
tutoring
if
you're
behind
stop
being
a
loner
and
go
out
and
make
some
friends
it's
really
not
that
hard
you
have
it
wayyy
easier
than
you
think
1252
my
dads
a
doctor
nd
told
me
i
should
steer
far
away
from
the
profession
my
moms
living
off
child
custody
and
welfare
and
advises
a
profession
with
fat
paychecks
yeah
i
get
it
the
grass
is
greener
but
did
the
middle
ground
disappear
like
a
normal
human
being
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
my
education
here
but
i
can't
shake
the
thought
that
i'm
going
nowhere
i'll
just
live
it
up
i
guess
are
you
fucking
kidding
me
i
kinda
came
to
terms
with
it
when
it
was
for
the
entire
student
population
but
"12,000"
for
a
party
for
a
quarter
of
the
school
i
understand
that
it's
a
health
hazard
but
that
is
so
fucked
up
freshmen
can't
go
abroad
because
there's
no
financial
aid
left
but
spending
"12,000"
on
a
party
for
only
500
people
is
a
better
use
of
money
i
must
be
going
insane
someone
tell
me
how
this
makes
any
sense
at
all
so
update
3
the
cat's
out
of
the
bag
someone
couldn't
keep
their
big
whore
mouth
shut
jk
girl
but
seriously
you
are
the
last
person
i'm
telling
my
life
stories
to
now
so
the
handful
of
people
in
my
major
that
i
hang
with
all
know
now
and
i'm
writing
the
rest
of
this
update
with
the
assumption
they're
going
to
see
it
this
is
also
probably
my
last
update
on
this
topic
at
least
you
might
see
more
of
me
in
the
future
i
have
not
heard
that
anyone
has
told
him
about
these
confessions
nor
has
he
mentioned
it
to
any
of
those
guys
we
are
mutual
friends
with
so
i
assume
either
he
hasn't
seen
it
or
he's
too
fucking
vain
to
think
that
any
girl
wouldn't
be
interested
in
him
so
let
me
spill
all
the
little
deets
i
left
out
before
just
so
this
twat
can't
possibly
mistake
this
for
someone
else
telling
me
you've
got
old
material
from
this
course
that
you'll
email
it
to
me
if
i
text
you
my
email
address
is
hands
down
the
lamest
way
to
score
my
digits
it
didn't
fool
me
but
i
really
wanted
those
old
homeworks
because
that
shit
takes
forever
asking
me
what
my
father
does
just
to
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
about
your
dad
is
fucking
weird
like
i
get
now
that
you
clearly
have
some
serious
daddy
issues
it
doesn't
impress
me
that
your
father
is
some
hot
shot
lawyer
from
some
podunk
town
in
the
middle
of
buttfuck
nowhere
texas
i
really
don't
get
where
you
were
going
with
that
you
car
is
ugly
every
fucking
daddy's
boy
has
a
souped
up
mustang
the
fact
that
you
clearly
expected
such
a
sweet
ride
to
impress
me
to
the
point
that
you
were
showing
me
pics
on
your
phone
is
gay
what
was
i
supposed
to
say
like
omg
your
car
is
soooooo
cool
your
dick
must
be
huge
i
mean
really
come
on
bro
lifted
truck
or
gtfo
if
you
actually
thought
paying
for
my
meal
was
going
to
get
you
in
my
pants
you're
sorely
mistaken
after
all
that
shit
you
pulled
during
the
meal
no
girl
is
ever
going
to
mistake
you
for
a
gentleman
not
to
mention
i
ordered
one
of
the
cheapest
things
on
the
menu
i
don't
think
even
a
back
alley
crack
whore
is
going
to
put
out
for
7.99
plus
tax
and
tip
speaking
of
tip
who
the
fuck
leaves
that
little
i've
never
been
a
waiter
but
i
know
how
hard
it
is
to
do
what
they
do
and
i
never
leave
less
than
15
you
left
barely
a
dollar
on
a
20
dollar
meal
you're
a
fucking
cunt
a
huge
goddamn
thundercunt
you
are
so
functionally
retarded
on
every
level
i'm
shocked
you've
managed
to
make
it
this
far
without
getting
shanked
by
someone
i
mean
really
i
get
that
boys
have
their
little
bro
chats
but
that
talk
should
never
ever
ever
make
it
back
to
the
girl
in
question
don't
get
me
wrong
i'm
flattered
that
a
rather
large
group
of
males
my
age
thinks
i
have
a
great
set
of
tits
ain't
nothing
wrong
with
that
tits
are
great
it's
not
like
you
can
motorboat
a
personality
but
the
fact
that
you
a
guy
who
attempted
to
have
some
kind
of
relationship
with
me
brought
this
up
in
front
of
them
is
creepy
as
fuck
that
and
the
fact
that
at
least
a
few
of
these
people
liked
me
way
more
than
they
liked
you
and
came
and
told
me
all
about
this
nobody
wants
a
dude
that
kisses
and
tells
or
in
your
case
misses
and
tells
and
finally
dude
get
over
it
you
had
your
chance
and
you
fucked
up
you
done
fucked
up
big
you're
not
going
to
get
a
second
chance
so
stop
trying
to
talk
to
me
stop
sitting
behind
me
in
class
i
can
feel
your
creepy
little
caca
brown
eyes
on
me
you're
trippin
if
you
think
those
are
hazel
brah
and
stop
telling
people
we're
cool
we're
not
cool
we're
never
gonna
be
cool
i'm
serious
about
this
being
my
last
update
i
don't
foresee
this
getting
beyond
petty
little
gossip
behind
my
back
and
being
a
creeper
boys
are
stupid
and
some
are
weird
as
fuck
either
he's
going
to
figure
that
out
or
not
and
either
way
it's
pointless
for
me
to
harp
over
every
stupid
thing
he
does
it's
a
total
waste
of
my
fucking
time
i've
go
are
sororities
and
fraternities
really
that
expensive
that
people
make
fun
of
them
about
buying
friends
don't
all
clubs
have
membership
fees
anyways
so
what's
the
difference
serious
question
12109
i'm
so
tired
of
being
one
of
the
few
people
here
that
doesn't
come
from
money
i
have
barely
enough
and
can't
afford
housing
but
i
have
to
watch
everyone
else
plan
elaborate
vacations
and
study
abroad
trips
i
know
it's
wrong
to
be
jealous
of
money
but
i
can't
help
it
where
are
the
people
like
me
on
this
campus
it
seriously
pisses
me
off
that
the
school
can
spend
25
million
on
a
new
stadium
100k
on
a
new
logo
but
still
justify
charging
me
30
k
a
year
as
an
out
of
state
student
and
when
i
can't
pay
my
bill
on
time
they
drop
me
and
now
i
risk
expulsion
how
about
you
take
that
money
and
give
it
to
the
kids
who
financially
need
the
aid
or
would
that
be
not
in
your
best
interest
as
it
looks
like
you
act
like
a
for
profit
university
serious
question
i
will
be
taking
over
my
families
business
when
i
graduate
so
i'll
be
pretty
well
off
how
do
i
go
about
finding
a
10
10
trophy
wife
the
kind
that
works
out
all
morning
and
manages
some
charity
during
the
day
do
i
just
go
to
a
sorority
and
show
them
my
watch
car
idk
i
don't
care
if
they
only
want
me
for
money
13355
i'm
about
to
be
homeless
but
my
friends
want
to
bitch
to
me
about
their
cushy
lives
my
secret
i
don't
give
an
actual
f
ck
i'm
starting
to
think
the
winter
parking
ban
is
yet
just
another
way
for
unh
to
make
money
off
of
us
poor
college
student
seriously
why
should
we
have
to
pay
75
parking
tickets
or
100
towing
expenses
just
for
parking
at
our
school
on
weekends
when
we
already
shell
out
so
much
for
tuition
why
are
people
so
sore
about
others
selling
sports
passes
for
high
prices
those
who
got
passes
before
they
ran
out
are
simply
trying
to
make
some
money
here
and
just
taking
advantage
of
the
market
value
for
these
passes
hello
capitalism
11579
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
just
give
all
of
this
up
leave
cornell
dreams
of
a
medical
school
renunciate
everything
and
become
a
buddhist
monk
wandering
in
asia
after
all
what
is
the
point
of
life
i'm
in
the
country's
top
school
actually
one
of
the
world's
top
schools
yet
so
many
of
us
are
miserable
all
this
constant
chasing
around
to
be
in
the
top
25
of
the
class
getting
a
good
job
chasing
for
wealth
thereafter
finding
a
soul
mate
maintaining
one
keeping
up
with
the
jones
working
all
day
till
you
drop
barely
having
time
for
family
no
seriously
what's
the
point
of
it
all
are
you
going
to
be
really
happy
once
you
get
a
wall
st
job
become
a
top
shot
supreme
court
lawyer
join
goldman
sachs
moments
of
disillusionment
before
a
final
5927
there's
a
lesson
some
people
here
need
to
learn
don't
put
others
down
you
are
an
asshole
if
you
do
there
will
always
be
someone
smarter
wealthier
happier
sexier
etc
than
you
on
campus
and
generally
life
i
mean
come
on
do
you
really
want
to
be
labeled
an
asshole
it's
like
when
those
two
guys
gave
me
a
dirty
look
for
not
casually
wearing
j
crew
that
quickly
changed
when
they
found
out
i
casually
wear
paul
stuart
that's
right
you
assholes
not
really
a
confession
but
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
other
ags
making
fun
or
hating
on
kids
that
are
blinn
team
or
go
to
blinn
some
people
aren't
as
blessed
to
have
everything
handed
to
them
like
most
of
you
i've
met
some
kids
that
go
to
blinn
that
work
twice
as
hard
as
a
lot
of
us
at
a
m
some
of
them
have
families
they
take
care
of
work
full
time
and
yet
still
go
to
school
full
time
some
of
them
i
have
met
also
had
to
work
to
support
themselves
in
high
school
and
when
you
have
to
support
yourself
making
anything
around
minimum
wage
you
can't
save
up
for
school
or
put
enough
time
in
their
studies
to
make
good
grades
it
really
makes
me
angry
when
i
see
other
ags
criticize
those
kids
one
because
you've
probably
never
been
in
their
shoes
to
have
to
work
and
support
yourself
hell
i'm
sure
a
lot
of
y'all
haven't
even
had
to
work
a
day
in
your
life
better
yet
support
yourself
two
being
an
ag
is
at
the
heart
and
having
certain
morals
most
of
you
who
had
parents
who
were
ags
would
understand
that
if
your
parents
are
alumni
then
naturally
growing
up
you
would
call
yourself
an
aggie
why
because
you
aspired
to
be
one
and
loved
the
idea
of
being
an
ag
having
the
heart
and
morals
of
an
ag
as
well
and
point
three
chewing
them
out
or
giving
them
crap
because
you
don't
think
their
an
aggie
makes
aggies
look
bad
if
some
one
told
you
who
you
could
and
couldn't
be
would
you
want
to
be
like
them
no
it
just
gives
us
bad
rep
and
makes
us
sound
snobby
if
anything
wouldn't
you
want
to
encourage
them
to
come
to
a
m
just
some
food
for
thought
the
next
time
i
physically
hear
some
one
say
that
about
a
blinn
kid
i'm
going
to
punch
them
in
the
face
being
rude
and
telling
people
who
they
are
and
who
they
aren't
isn't
what
a
true
aggie
would
do
930
i
know
it's
not
just
me
but
does
anyone
else
occasionally
see
that
yellow
lamborghini
and
silver
ferrari
circling
around
in
iv
not
sure
if
it's
some
spoiled
kid's
joy
ride
or
some
rich
asshole
probably
one
of
our
undeserving
landlords
but
the
driver
sure
loves
showing
it
off
and
making
loud
noises
and
one
more
thing
fuck
our
landlords
they
know
we're
here
temporarily
therefore
they
know
you
won't
take
action
against
them
i
love
a
m
have
lots
of
friends
there
and
really
enjoy
the
atmosphere
however
i
am
transferring
to
ut
to
finish
out
my
degree
that
makes
me
a
traitor
doesn't
it
don't
hate
gotta
follow
the
money
trail
lol
xd
this
was
probably
the
best
christmas
ive
ever
had
this
is
because
i
truly
understand
what
it
means
now
i
woke
up
and
had
a
delicious
breakfast
with
my
family
i
didn't
open
any
presents
after
nor
did
my
brothers
truth
is
my
mom
hasn't
been
able
to
afford
christmas
gifts
for
the
past
2
years
after
flipping
through
my
instagram
i
felt
a
little
jealous
seeing
my
friends
with
new
shoes
iphones
and
what
not
we
later
drove
out
to
my
aunts
and
uncles
house
who
are
unh
alumni
for
a
great
day
of
family
bonding
we
played
poker
made
a
bonfire
shot
some
guns
drank
a
shit
ton
and
shared
many
laughs
during
our
amazing
dinner
my
little
cousin
asked
what
did
you
guys
get
for
christmas
after
seeing
them
open
an
xbox
360
and
other
awesome
kid
things
earlier
there
was
an
obvious
awkward
moment
of
silence
i
then
replied
to
her
we
opened
our
hearts
and
received
family
health
and
love
this
year
i
am
truly
blessed
and
appreciate
everything
i
have
in
this
world
merry
christmas
wildcats
i
dread
going
home
to
my
mom
during
the
holidays
she
provides
everything
for
me
she
works
hard
for
me
she
pays
for
my
rent
my
utilities
and
my
food
but
throughout
my
life
she
has
taken
an
emotional
toll
on
me
we
used
to
have
everything
my
mom
was
successful
private
practice
attorney
in
houston
she
owned
4
different
rental
properties
along
with
our
"3,000"
square
foot
home
we
had
3
cars
including
a
mercedes
benz
i
had
a
texas
tomorrow
fund
college
savings
account
that
i
knew
about
since
i
was
about
6
years
old
as
far
as
i
knew
i
was
set
in
the
winter
of
2004
my
mom
announced
to
me
that
she
would
be
closing
her
private
practice
and
seeking
a
job
with
the
government
i
didn't
think
much
of
it
at
the
time
fast
fast
forward
to
my
senior
year
of
high
school
we
were
living
in
a
2
bed
room
apartment
with
1
car
shopping
at
the
dollar
store
but
thats
not
as
bad
as
what
i'm
about
to
tell
you
the
most
egregious
thing
my
mother
cashed
out
my
texas
tomorrow
college
savings
fund
and
spent
it
all
my
college
fund
my
fucking
college
fund
i
don't
know
where
that
money
went
now
i
have
about
"25,000"
in
student
loans
all
because
my
mom
has
terrible
fucking
foresight
and
thought
that
i
wasn't
going
to
go
to
college
i
admit
i
was
a
bit
of
a
fuck
up
but
did
she
really
think
that
low
of
me
that
she
had
to
cash
out
the
thing
that
would
allow
me
to
go
to
school
debt
free
but
thats
just
the
start
of
the
train
wreck
that
is
my
mother
and
i's
relationship
i
hardly
ever
speak
when
i'm
around
her
i'm
always
so
afraid
that
i
might
say
something
that
will
give
her
an
excuse
to
yell
at
me
or
criticize
when
she
brings
me
around
her
friends
she
always
says
something
that
isn't
true
about
me
like
for
example
a
common
thing
is
for
my
mom's
friends
to
ask
if
i'm
dating
or
engaged
i'll
say
no
quietly
but
she'll
say
he's
waiting
until
he
graduates
or
something
along
those
lines
thats
not
true
i'm
actively
seeking
relationships
in
fact
i
had
coffee
with
a
girl
the
other
day
which
is
a
good
segway
into
my
next
point
i'm
afraid
that
if
i
get
a
girlfriend
and
it
comes
to
a
point
where
we
meet
each
other's
parents
that
my
mom
will
get
upset
because
i'm
dating
a
white
girl
i'm
half
black
half
mexican
she
has
expressed
her
disapproval
of
the
idea
of
me
dating
a
white
girl
she
has
said
things
like
you
can
drive
white
cars
but
you
can't
bring
home
white
girls
this
is
really
concerning
to
me
see
although
i'm
brown
i'm
basically
an
oreo
brown
on
the
outside
white
on
the
inside
throughout
my
life
all
my
best
friends
have
been
white
so
i'm
most
comfortable
around
white
people
and
i
envision
myself
marrying
a
white
girl
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
fact
that
because
i
do
have
such
a
tough
relationship
with
my
mother
that
my
ideal
girl
a
girl
who
values
family
a
lot
will
think
less
of
me
because
of
that
i
dont
know
what
to
do
and
i
start
to
think
about
these
things
especially
around
the
holidays
when
i
have
to
go
back
to
her
and
everyone
else
with
what
seems
to
be
a
great
relationship
with
both
their
parents
goes
back
home
and
i
also
think
about
the
relationship
with
my
mom
think
about
getting
married
i
like
the
idea
of
getting
married
but
i
also
think
about
the
intricacies
that
lead
up
to
marriage
which
include
meeting
the
future
in
laws
remember
when
unh
spent
nearly
"100,000"
of
our
tuition
dollars
on
logo
designs
last
spring
you
know
the
exorbitantly
expensive
ones
a
toddler
could
have
drawn
the
unh
administration
is
having
an
unveiling
ceremony
for
the
chosen
logo
at
the
hockey
game
next
saturday
with
so
much
student
talent
abundant
and
free
if
the
administration
goes
with
a
firm
designed
logo
i'll
be
booing
it
i
hope
the
student
section
will
boo
along
with
me
5161
i
am
in
shock
after
hearing
that
most
students
in
my
program
at
nyu
buenos
aires
ask
their
parents
for
money
to
be
able
to
go
on
spring
break
in
different
countries
among
other
things
like
shopping
and
going
out
they
pay
for
your
tuition
and
board
isn't
that
enough
some
people
need
to
grow
up
and
get
a
job
154
i
am
almost
paralyzed
by
anxiety
on
a
daily
basis
in
regards
to
my
future
my
student
loans
and
the
financial
stress
that
i'm
placing
on
my
family
to
attend
college
my
parents
can
pass
the
credit
check
needed
to
get
the
loans
but
i
don't
know
if
they
can
afford
to
pay
them
back
worse
i
don't
know
if
they
understand
just
how
much
debt
i'll
incur
by
the
time
i
graduate
from
law
school
sometimes
i
consider
dropping
out
because
then
at
least
i'll
stop
accumulating
debt
but
if
i
do
that
i'll
definitely
have
no
way
to
help
them
repay
the
5
figure
debt
i've
already
incurred
by
the
end
of
my
second
year
of
college
i'm
trapped
on
the
path
i
already
chose
sometimes
i'm
idly
suicidal
because
if
i
die
the
debt
would
be
forgiven
but
i
couldn't
do
that
to
my
family
and
friends
no
i've
made
my
bed
i
know
they
want
me
to
achieve
great
things
and
i
want
to
live
up
to
their
expectations
and
my
own
and
i
know
their
number
one
concern
is
that
i'm
happy
and
successful
but
i
don't
think
i'm
worth
the
confidence
they
place
in
me
i
think
i'm
depressed
but
i
feel
as
if
i
have
no
right
to
be
depressed
there
are
people
with
lives
many
times
worse
than
my
own
who
am
i
to
let
such
relatively
petty
concerns
drag
me
down
i'm
stressed
convinced
of
my
own
weakness
and
inferiority
consumed
by
self
loathing
for
feeling
bad
over
relatively
nothing
and
i
just
can't
stop
thinking
about
what
will
happen
when
those
loans
need
to
be
repaid
i
stopped
looking
forward
to
the
future
a
long
time
ago
because
it
has
nothing
good
in
store
for
my
family
and
i
admin
says
i
know
this
is
a
lot
more
depth
than
our
regularly
scheduled
programming
but
it's
a
cry
for
help
and
i
think
a
lot
of
us
can
relate
i'm
no
expert
and
i
don't
know
your
situation
but
it
sounds
like
if
you
aren't
already
you
need
to
be
letting
all
this
out
to
somebody
you
must
to
have
confessed
it
most
people
get
depressed
periodically
whether
they
have
a
right
to
be
or
not
you're
not
doing
anyone
any
good
by
hurting
right
even
idle
suicidal
thoughts
are
important
and
as
a
student
you
can
see
the
counselors
here
for
free
their
number
is
503
768
7160
i'm
not
trying
to
patronize
you
obviously
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
this
community
is
here
for
you
hope
this
helps
1141
i
love
this
school
but
wish
it
wasn't
so
expensive
sometimes
i'm
tired
of
seeing
friends
get
sent
over
the
edge
by
the
stress
and
lack
of
time
they
have
by
having
to
work
and
be
an
excelling
full
time
student
is
this
just
sophomore
year
that's
like
this
i
feel
like
we're
all
dying
a
little
right
now
i
go
through
the
self
checkout
line
at
the
grocery
store
and
type
in
codes
for
cheaper
produce
than
the
produce
i
have
in
my
basket
it's
pretty
much
stealing
i
can't
help
it
i'm
broke
and
hungry
does
this
make
me
a
bad
person
i
have
been
so
guilty
about
this
lately
why
is
it
that
some
people
say
that
they
never
felt
poor
before
coming
to
kenyon
i
don't
see
anyone
flaunting
their
wealth
or
treating
people
differently
because
of
their
wealth
and
the
fact
that
i
don't
see
that
makes
me
worry
that
i
may
be
one
of
the
students
causing
the
problem
i
apologize
if
that
is
the
case
6958
i
am
a
recent
alum
and
reading
these
posts
makes
me
nostalgic
for
the
my
time
at
cornell
when
i
was
blissfully
ignorant
of
how
hard
it
is
to
find
a
job
post
graduation
that
uses
my
skills
and
credentials
the
next
time
i
hear
whoa
you
went
to
cornell
then
what
are
you
doing
here
at
my
low
wage
temporary
job
i
think
i
will
burst
into
tears
or
punch
the
person
in
the
face
11632
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
at
cornell
about
the
unfair
advantages
that
big
financial
companies
and
law
firms
have
in
recruiting
the
top
students
at
our
so
called
elite
university
but
this
is
just
flat
out
wrong
imagine
the
titanic
occurred
today
as
soon
as
it
hit
the
iceberg
word
goes
out
around
the
world
of
what
has
happened
but
no
body
yet
knows
what
the
end
result
is
are
you
going
to
congratulate
someone
who
at
that
moment
buys
a
ticket
for
the
titanic's
return
trip
from
london
to
new
york
no
you're
going
to
tell
them
that
they're
an
idiot
anyone
who
doesn't
realize
that
our
entire
financial
structure
is
fundamentally
broken
and
that
it
is
either
going
to
collapse
or
be
completely
gutted
is
just
as
idiotic
so
yes
it
is
wrong
that
cornell
pushes
so
many
of
it's
students
towards
these
prestigious
jobs
but
if
these
kids
want
to
go
then
fuck
it
i
don't
give
a
shit
anyone
so
oblivious
to
the
world
around
them
isn't
going
to
be
much
help
in
any
other
field
because
they're
too
fucking
self
absorbed
and
blinded
to
be
productive
in
any
meaningful
way
just
to
be
clear
every
one
of
you
that
is
planning
on
going
to
work
for
some
big
shot
law
or
financial
firm
you
are
an
idiot
to
the
rest
of
the
students
here
yeah
it
sucks
that
cornell
values
idiots
that
make
a
lot
of
money
over
everyone
else
and
it's
annoying
whenever
cornell
tries
to
make
me
follow
in
their
path
but
take
solace
in
the
fact
that
all
of
these
idiots
are
going
to
be
much
worse
off
in
20
years
from
now
then
you
they'll
have
no
jobs
no
money
and
everyone
in
our
society
will
hate
them
so
how
about
we
get
a
head
start
and
start
treating
these
people
like
what
they
are
idiots
4841
it
just
dawned
on
me
like
a
stack
of
bricks
that
i'm
going
to
be
homeless
in
nyc
this
summer
i
can't
go
home
and
i
don't
have
the
money
for
summer
housing
at
all
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
to
make
plans
of
survival
coles
gym
locker
and
bobst
ll
shit
shit
fuck
i'm
panicking
so
badly
right
now
2463
to
all
on
georgetown
confessions
i
think
it's
time
that
we
all
accept
that
gc
has
devolved
into
a
space
that
is
neither
constructive
nor
uplifting
instead
it
serves
as
a
place
for
people
to
share
their
real
or
perceived
grievances
with
others
please
do
not
take
this
as
a
criticism
of
gc
itself
it
only
serves
as
a
vessel
for
the
words
that
individuals
choose
to
share
whether
your
insecurity
stems
from
wealth
or
lack
thereof
a
perception
that
you
should
have
gone
to
a
better
school
or
a
belief
that
people
don't
appreciate
your
beauty
charisma
wit
etc
there
are
simply
better
and
more
constructive
ways
to
vent
your
frustration
than
online
and
from
behind
a
curtain
of
anonymity
no
less
please
stop
spewing
hatred
jealousy
and
petty
slights
it
doesn't
help
you
it
doesn't
help
me
it
doesn't
help
anyone
it
creates
an
environment
so
toxic
and
reeking
of
distrust
and
animosity
that
no
hazmat
crew
could
clean
it
up
a
if
you
go
to
this
school
be
kind
and
work
hard
you
will
be
fine
monetarily
and
otherwise
with
that
said
never
allow
someone's
material
wealth
to
serve
as
an
indicator
of
their
self
worth
or
yours
some
of
the
most
successful
and
influential
people
i
have
met
in
my
life
were
not
the
wealthiest
holler
at
all
my
favorite
underpaid
junior
and
adjunct
professors
b
you're
at
an
amazing
school
fine
so
it's
not
harvard
yale
or
princeton
but
if
that
bothers
you
get
over
it
you're
here
make
the
very
best
of
your
amazing
world
class
education
and
if
you
really
believe
that
you
were
meant
to
go
hyp
then
apply
to
transfer
c
those
that
don't
appreciate
your
qualities
aren't
necessarily
flawed
or
bad
people
everyone
here
is
very
busy
and
sucked
into
their
own
lives
and
circles
which
is
completely
normal
life
is
too
short
to
give
a
damn
what
others
outside
of
family
and
close
friends
think
of
you
never
mistake
scarcity
for
value
we
as
a
school
and
a
community
are
only
as
strong
as
our
weakest
link
so
rather
than
acting
like
petulant
and
petty
children
everyone
that
is
tempted
to
write
something
hurtful
spurning
or
vindictive
on
this
page
please
stop
and
ask
yourself
these
two
questions
would
i
write
this
if
it
wasn't
anonymous
will
what
i
am
about
to
say
make
this
school
a
better
place

i
despise
them
too
so
what
if
it's
my
parents
paying
for
it
my
family
has
to
pay
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
for
my
education
you
don't
ever
i
wish
the
only
financial
aid
cornell
gave
was
interest
free

then
everyone
will
have
to
pay
the
same
price
for
the
same
education
i
can't
get
by
with
my
9
to
5
and
i
can't
provide
the
right
type
of
life
for
my

i
feel
weird
whenever
my
friends
make
remarks
such
as
we're
paying
"50,000"
tuition
and
you're
complaining
about
the
cost
of
that
i
have
100
financial
aid
and
i
do
have
trouble
affording
trivial
things
because
it
adds
up
so
i
refuse
going
to
parties
sometimes
i
don't
complain
for
the
sake
of
complaining
and
i'm
not
trying
to
whine
i'm
just
telling
the
truth
4842
will
staring
at
2014
2015
housing
rates
make
them
decrease
i
really
cant
afford
it
howdy
i
have
a
question
and
i
hope
somebody
can
help
me
out
here
let's
say
a
student
wants
to
transfer
from
a
good
school
to
another
one
due
to
financial
problems
would
financial
problem
be
a
good
reason
to
write
on
the
college
transfer
essay
if
not
what
would
be
a
better
reason
thanks
i
don't
want
my
tuition
money
to
pay
for
these
extravagant
and
unnecessary
expenses
the
money
should
go
to
more
scholarships
and
aid
to
students

unh
dining
again
on
the
unh
dining
topic
there
should
be
a
tiered
dining
plan
offered
where
the
first
50
swipes
cost
like
i
don't
knoww
9
the
next
50
swipes
cost
8
each
the
next
50
cost
7
each
and
so
on
this
would
make
it
so
that
you
would
be
counting
up
instead
of
counting
down
and
possibly
wasting
swipes
if
the
cost
of
dining
diminished
the
more
you
went
then
you
would
probably
be
more
likely
to
justify
it
to
yourself
to
go
over
into
that
next
tier
this
way
the
university
is
making
more
money
than
they
would
had
you
stopped
once
you
ran
out
plus
it
costs
that
much
less
and
it
is
easier
to
justify
to
yourself
to
go
and
best
of
all
you
don't
need
to
buy
a
bunch
of
swipes
when
you
run
out
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
p.s
is
it
bad
that
i
post
my
good
ideas
here
because
if
i
posted
them
under
my
name
people
wouldn't
take
them
seriously

i
work

and
i
am
about

also
worked

all

i
don't

do

have
any
advice

graduation
is
freaking
me
the
f
out
according
to
the
wall
st
journal
about
1.5
million
or
53.6
of
bachelor's
degree
holders
under
the
age
of
25
last
year
were
jobless
or
underemployed
the
highest
11
years
it's
much
harder
to
pay
back
loans
while
working
for
tips
at
olive
garden
than
when
you
have
a
decent
office
job
i
wanted
to
take
a
year
off
and
teach
abroad
then
go
grad
school
but
it
might
be
disastrous
i'm
not
part
of
a
privileged
family
that
live
in
a
big
house
i
don't
want
to
live
at
home
my
mom
is
kind
of
a
drag
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
pay
for
my
own
medical
auto
insurance
car
payment
cell
credit
cards
what
happened
to
the
american
dream
after
college
fuck
my
parents
old
ass
doctors
that
want
me
to
major
in
biology
and
then
go
to
medical
school
no
no
fuck
you
i
wanna
major
in
business
or
liberal
arts
and
do
something
fun
with
my
life
fuck
treating
rich
people
only
and
turning
away
the
poor
because
they
don't
have
money
and
crushing
people's
dreams
and
ending
people's
lives
and
countless
years
of
school
and
joining
the
illuminati
and
who
knows
what
else
fuck
it
all
my
friend
complains
about
students
whose
parents
pay
all
their
rent
yet
her
parents
pay
half
her
rent
and
i'm
over
here
paying
all
of
my
rent
so
can
i
slap
her
now

i
was
just
officially
offered
my
spot
abroad
next
year
which
is
necessary
to
meet
my
graduation
requirements
as
a
global
liberal
studies
student
my
excitement
was
quickly
dashed
however
upon
seeing
that
in
order
to
secure
said
spot
abroad
a
500
dollar
deposit
is
recommended
before
march
15th
no
one
ever
mentioned
to
us
that
that
would
be
a
condition
of
acceptance
and
who
gives
a
person
less
than
two
weeks
to
find
that
kind
of
lump
of
cash
this
was
a
graduation
requirement
of
my
major
not
my
own
whimsical
want
to
spend
another
year
out
of
the
country
though
granted
i
am
excited
and
fortunate
for
the
opportunity
and
the
fact
that
they
casually
hit
us
up
over
and
over
for
more
money
is
disgusting
i
am
willing
to
put
myself
at
financial
risk
and
take
out
the
loans
necessary
to
go
here
but
random
last
minute
emails
hitting
me
up
for
money
at
such
short
notice
is
absolutely
ridiculous
i
don't
even
feel
comfortable
mentioning
this
to
my
parents
are
they
supposed
to
not
feed
my
siblings
and
or
skip
a
mortgage
payment
because
nyu
is
trying
to
shake
the
money
tree's
trunk
some
more
11569
these
are
first
world
problems
cause
many
3rd
world
people
would
think
we're
fucking
crazy
they
would
be
like
you
guys
can
secure
a
job
housing
and
food
right
now
yet
you
still
subject
yourself
to
large
amounts
of
stress
cause
you
want
more
how
many
people
have
signed
their
lease
at
northpoint
it
seems
like
all
the
rich
kids
are
going
to
live
there
and
have
their
own
clique
and
i
don't
want
to
be
the
odd
one
out
i
find
it
completely
ridiculous
how
much
out
of
state
tuition
is
it's
all
a
load
of
shit
twice
as
much
as
if
i
had
graduated
from
a
high
school
in
texas
where's
the
logic
in
that
if
i
choose
to
come
to
school
here
you'll
get
just
as
much
in
tax
money
as
you
would
if
i
was
a
resident
which
now
i
am
and
have
been
for
three
years
loftin
sharp
and
the
regents
your
logic
on
basically
everything
is
completely
ridiculous
my
5
yr
old
nephew
could
run
this
university
better
than
you
all
have
done
i
recently
helped
a
friend
with
her
midterm
paper
you
know
just
helping
her
with
better
word
choice
grammar
issues
and
smooth
transitions
now
i
really
don't
think
i'm
the
smartest
cookie
on
the
block
but
after
looking
at
her
paper
and
the
help
i've
given
her
throughout
the
year
i
don't
know
how
she
got
in
to
texas
a
m
and
on
top
of
that
i'm
frustrated
she
has
a
nearly
full
ride
here
so
my
two
problems
here
why
did
they
let
someone
who
can
barely
spell
vulnerable
perhaps
and
other
words
i
find
to
be
simple
middle
school
words
into
such
a
high
and
prestigious
public
university
such
as
a
m
and
why
are
they
spending
so
much
money
to
send
her
to
texas
a
m
wouldn't
it
be
easier
for
her
and
her
family
to
do
the
two
years
community
college
then
two
years
at
a
university
like
a
m
i
love
her
as
a
friend
and
i'm
so
happy
to
have
met
her
and
help
her
cause
i
really
do
enjoy
helping
my
friends
when
i
can
but
it
stings
and
i
cringe
each
time
she
makes
middle
school
and
hs
freshman
mistakes
i
want
her
to
succeed
but
at
the
same
i
feel
slighted
by
her
being
here
like
my
degree
here
has
almost
less
value
i've
never
seen
myself
as
above
someone
with
average
intelligence
but
i'm
starting
to
after
only
spending
a
semester
here
tl
dr
op
helped
friend
with
paper
and
hw
and
realized
that
a
m
let
some
pretty
uneducated
people
in
here
op
feels
value
of
a
m
degree
is
decreased
by
people
like
friend
feels
bad
for
thinking
less
of
friend
due
to
being
less
educated
coming
into
college
and
nearly
full
ride
here
wheres
a
good
place
in
college
station
to
work
i
had
a
job
last
semester
waitressing
but
wasn't
making
enough
to
pay
all
my
bills
teenagers
just
don't
tip
like
people
do
in
houston
or
dallas
but
it
also
doesn't
help
the
restaurant
was
dead
where
do
you
guys
work
who's
hiring
14952
ok
so
i'm
guilty
of
having
heavily
padded
up
my
cv
to
get
into
cornell
the
senator
i
worked
wth
for
a
month
he's
my
dad's
best
friend
just
went
to
his
office
for
an
hour
or
two
max
and
my
volunteering
in
asia
well
it
was
made
up
i
went
there
on
a
holiday
instead
there's
a
reason
why
college
admissions
suck
terribly
in
this
country
having
just
graduated
top
of
my
class
and
getting
great
scores
on
tests
isn't
enough
there's
a
reason
why
minorities
and
the
poor
have
it
tough
getting
into
the
ivies
all
the
extra
intangible
crap
that
you
have
to
do
to
show
that
you're
better
than
the
rest
is
just
really
really
frustrating
especially
if
you
re
sure
you
want
to
go
into
stem
fields
sorry
to
all
the
rest
who
think
all
this
matters
i
guess
i'm
just
being
honest
here
here's
my
summary
of
the
largely
imaginary
dialog
on
finances
of
the
last
few
years
students
we
need
lots
of
things
but
most
of
all
a
new
hamilton
smith
it
is
literally
falling
apart
also
non
ruinous
state
tuition
that's
not
higher
than
most
private
schools
would
be
nice
administration
we
have
no
money
accepts
check
from
peter
t
paul
for
half
of
a
new
business
school
nobody
asked
for
we're
building
a
business
school
but
it's
okay
because
we'll
raise
all
the
money
raises
literally
zero
money
it's
okay
because
we
can
borrow
all
the
money
and
simply
charge
future
students
which
aren't
real
students
at
all
nh
you
guys
are
fuckwits
we're
cutting
your
allowance
by
half
until
you
stop
blowing
it
on
crack
and
business
schools
hamilton
smith
partially
implodes
burning
students
and
faculty
with
steam
from
ruptured
pipes
students
ahhhh
administration
shut
up
damn
it
we
have
no
money
because
the
legislature
took
it
clinks
champagne
glasses
with
paul
trips
over
a
pile
of
unused
lcds
in
the
new
business
school
fine
we'll
do
it
in
a
few
years
maybe
despite
having
no
money
unh
announces
plans
for
"25,000,000"
stadium
renovation
everyone
wtf
administration
what
do
you
mean
how
are
we
going
to
pay
for
it
there's
money
everywhere
look
people
writing
checks
left
and
right
we'll
raise
it
all
even
if
not
unh
has
all
the
money
we've
been
saving
it
because
we're
frugal
nh
what
administration
if
we
don't
replace
the
seats
at
our
stadium
nobody
will
want
to
come
hereeeeeeeeee
rest
of
the
world
we
don't
want
to
go
there
because
you're
ungodly
expensive
and
also
because
you're
becoming
a
business
school
run
by
people
who
make
unbelievably
shitty
business
decisions
ham
smith
students
hands
receding
into
rubble
aaaahhhh
what
are
some
apartments
that
are
under
or
around
500
it
really
only
has
to
be
livable
doesnt
need
to
be
anything
spectacular
or
good
for
that
matter
but
its
nice
to
have
