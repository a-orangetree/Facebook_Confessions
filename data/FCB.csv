Sex,"Somewhere, baby, it's part of me, apart from me, you're laying waste to Halloween, you fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street, you're in Milwaukee, off your feet. I've been in love with the same girl since the sixth grade of high school. We were only actually together for 6 months of senior year, and those six months were the best months of my life. For all those who embrace the hook-up culture at CC, you are lying to everyone around you, and yourself. Meaningless sex will not fulfill you. A two week relationship will not fill the inadequacies you feel within you. Your stats or highest score will not make you feel better about yourself, or teach you about your sexuality. An orgasm in not love. An orgasm is animal instinct. I represent the quiet conglomerate of men who will refuse to be impressed by how much you drink, you're various piercings, how well you know how to suck a dick, how understanding you are of what you like, or how well you dance. I would rather you tell me about yourself, your favorite musician, food, movie, etc., over dinner than I would have you tell me while we're already in bed, after I had asked for your drunken consent following the 2-4 beer pong games I had won and shouted about well within your earshot, and then have you gone by the time I wake up. I love nothing more than hearing the way you sound when you let me stick my hand between your legs, but I am more enamored by how we both feel watching a movie or seeing a concert together than I am by anything that happens sexually between us. Nothing, not sex, drugs, nor rock-and-roll, can possibly feel better than loving someone and having them love you back. And if you feel nothing in moving on to the next hook-up, you probably should not have hooked-up to begin with. I am a freshman, and my older brother went to CC and graduated here in 2008. He didn't have a single meaningful relationship here his entire college career. All he can look back on is meaningless sex and disappointment. Yes, some might call us a progressive school, despite the fact that the event we've had thus far with the largest amount of school-funding included both a loosely ordained theme of ice (yes it is cold in wintertime colorado), and a schedule of which loosely-clad girls would be dancing on stage at specific times. But, are relationships really helped by our type of progression? Is the hook-up culture really something we should feel pride in? I think not. At heart, I am a romantic, and fuck this school for making me feel like I am the outcast because of that. If I am still in love with the same girl that I first fell in love with since the sixth grade, then I am more than confident that anyone reading this can relate in some small way. So fuck everyone who is tries to act any different just to fit in with this supposed culture. It is not organic, it is forced. Love is organic. Love can never be forced.",2,548,323,31,17

Seriously? Of course it is understood that there are running costs.  My program administrator also said 'we do not have a pool of money here waiting for international students to take advantage of'. I wanted to be silent about this because I am considered a minority but I feel like not being heard is no reason to remain in silence because there might be someone in my shoes out there.

Honestly, I would have no problem dating her, but I'm really worried about what my friends would think. My friends have high expectations for the girls I date, I don't mean to brag, but I've dated girls with toned bodies or really nice bodies, and I feel that by dating this girl, they would think less of me. I know some of y'all are going to say that my friends should accept me and stupid crap like that, but that's the thing, they do, I'm just worried that their expectations of the girls I date and of my taste in women would drop and they would kind of, on a subconscious level, respect me less. They'd still remain my friends and whatnot, but I just know that they'd think less of me, at least on a subconscious level.

First of all, how rude of you to point someone out who was sleeping during class. It is none of your business to embarrass other people just because they might not being attention in class. If the professor feels that it is something that is disturbing the class then the professor will do something not the student. You know why it is none of your business? Because people are paying for their education here and they have the choice to either pay attention in the class and get superior grades or not pay attention and do something else. Either way they will end up paying for their own education and deserve the grade that they get based on their performance on class. Who knows that person might be an athlete who woke up early for practice that is why he was tired in class or maybe he stayed up late doing homework and didn't get the enough sleep, but still manage to go to class. Maybe that person had one of these situation and that is why he needed a little shut eye in order to concentrate who knows? I would also like to indicate that because of you indicating this person sleeping in class you not only disturb the class, but also you made the class feel uneasy/uncomfortable. Next time think about your actions and how it can affect others because talking. Second point I want to state is that you can't force people to participate in class if they don't want to. Maybe you might find it a boring class, but others might like listening to others that is why they don't talk in discussion or maybe they are very shy people. I can keep going but yeah that remark I feel was very unnecessary to spit out in class and was like a slap in the face to all the students in that class. I used to view you a good person in class, but now my view tends to be negative and dislike you. I don't know if I am the only one in the class that feels this way, but I feel like a coward for not speaking up in class.",91,406,262,12,11

I just want to let you know that it's okay to be upset sometimes and not smile. No one is going to punish you for being happy and no one is going to punish you for being sad. Sory I know this is pathetic to pretty much confess that I'm attracted towards you through this but this is my pathetic way of making sure that you will be okay. You have seriously been the only thing on my mind the whole day since I saw you. You seem like the perfect girl. You are nice, funny, outgoing, caring, and beautiful.

You dismiss the problem by claiming that those horrifying statistics come about just because these are the people that are generally in situations where things can go wrong. That's the problem though!! The Greek system should be actively taking steps to ensure that there are no such situations where things can go wrong. You can still party obviously, but drinking to the point of making these DUMB decisions and creating a culture where objectifying women is even CONSIDERED acceptable public behavior (see: the jugs fundraiser) is not necessary and needs to change now.  The problem is not partying itself. You can party without raping people.

I said it. You were one of the biggest mistakes of my life. And I don't mean to make it sound like that it's entirely your fault. I didn't have to let you in to my fragile, little world. I didn't have to hold on to my feelings for you. I didn't have to deal with your bullshit. But I did. Because what I felt for you was real. I really, really fucking loved you and I still care about you. I care about what happens to you. We used to be best friends for life before we started a relationship. And now we're just nothing. Just strangers again. But that's not my issue. I can deal with that. I'm fine without you. I sometimes go to your Facebook and scroll through and look at pictures of you and feel nothing. I mean, there's some sadness, but not emptiness. I miss you, but not painfully so. I guess this is what happens when you feel like the majority of it all was a lie. That you weren't feeling as much as you led me on to believe. You fucked up and you lied about it and came clean about it months after. MONTHS. THAT'S MANIPULATIVE AS FUCK. HOW COULD I EVER TRUST YOU AGAIN? I don't care about your reasoning behind it. It was selfish, and you know it. Don't tell me that it was because you didn't want to hurt me, because you know what? I know that if you came clean about it in the first place, that would have hurt way less than having to deal with you breaking up with me yet still sticking around and trying to make something work, then FINALLY telling me the truth and me not knowing what to do or what to believe. I felt that we had made so much progress at that point, we couldn't just stop. But it should have stopped. I should have told you to fuck right off. Because if you were lying about that, you could have been lying about anything and everything. And it was nice to hear that you were telling our friend (THE ONE I HAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOU BEING IN LOVE WITH WHEN I WAS STARTING TO REALLY LIKE YOU AND FALL FOR YOU YOU FUCKING IDIOT) weren't sure if I was the one you wanted to be with from her boyfriend, because he was suspicious as fuck about you and I think he's justified in it, because I'm definitely suspicious as fuck about you now. And even though I wasn't told about this until after I broke up with you, that stabbed me in the fucking heart. That pissed me the fuck off. Like, you're a liar. I opened up to you, and did my very best to make you feel like you could be honest with me, too. And you just completely shit on that. You took advantage of my trust and my love. And you know what? You were a total dick to me, and I didn't deserve that. Quite frankly, I gave you my all, I gave you every single chance I could muster for you, I was patient, I was sincere. As for you? I have no idea. I believe that you were devastated when I ended it, but as for WHY exactly, I have no idea. It could be anything. But I don't buy into this notion that it was because you were so sure that you loved me and wanted to be with me. I just think that's a typical reaction of someone who's experiencing loss. I'm so glad that I met someone and that I immediately liked him and that we kind of clicked. Although I know something may never happen with this guy because, you know, LIFE (and because I'm a bit emotionally unhinged and insecure and unable to trust at the same level as I used to), but it just...snapped me out of it. So I ended it. And saw things our relationship for what it was: shitty and deceitful. I fucked up, but I told you about it the next day because I knew you deserved to know.

I ask questions about their work. What do you do? What does quantum string theory have to do with waffles? Why does a construction company need a geologist? But nobody ever asks me what an omnicient morality license is, or why a film needs a certain type of plot, or what my most recent book is about, or cares about the stories I love to imagine. Nobody cares about the music I listen to, or why I only listen to sad piano melodies, or cares why I want to learn a certain type of music on that piano. Or why I listen to epic music on youtube, or why I want to do anything. No, they ask how college is going. And why I don't have a girlfriend yet. And why I don't seem to care about anything that I do. Why should I care? Nobody else does.  Sometimes I think that if there were just one person that really cared, that I could talk with, openly and freely, about everything in my life, no matter what. That could talk to me and joke and laugh and do things with, that was just fun to be around and always brightened my day even when it was as bad as it could possibly be...that I'd go into the depths of hell for them. Not necessarily to get them out(though that would obviously be the first priority) but just to be there with them. Because not being with them, being alone anywhere else, would be worse than braving hell for them.  And just because I don't have a person like that doesn't make those feelings any different. Oh sure, you laugh, and you joke, and you hope that the next person you see will be them, but each disappointment, each failed chance, just makes you draw further and further into yourself. Until the person the rest of the world experiences is just some caricature of who you really are, this two dimensional version of yourself without any depth and that has stopped hiding its feelings and no longer feels anything at all. And after a while that posterboard of yourself Is all that's left, just a shell with no heart and no soul, just a bright smile over a black abyss that used to be you.  That's what I feel like. Not only at 5 in the morning, like when I'm writing this, when tiredness and strain and lies have cracked the shell until only the hole is left, but all the time. Hiding. In the little hints at the edge of your eyes, and the crease in your smile. In the laugh that is a fraction of a second shorter than it should have been. In the jokes that are a bit too self deprecating, a bit too hostile to a hostile world. Always, sitting and waiting to come out like a wild animal, spitting at the light. And the only thing you have left to worry about, everything else destroyed because you no longer worry about what's become impossible, is that eternal worry that if you ever did have that stroke of luck, that tiny piece of fortune that leads you to that perfect person, that you'll no longer be the man you used to be.

None,"Howdy!         First Id like to start off by saying that I am today and every other day proud to call myself a Fightin Texas Aggie. Having said that I am reminded of all the things that carries with it when I introduce myself to other people. Yes, it comes with Aggie Jokes and the general rivalry comments that come up when you tell people this, but when someone asks me if I enjoy it at Texas A&M there is only ever one answer, I wouldnt go anywhere else. Then the follow up Whys that? I always give the same answer Because Texas A&M is different, its a university where students will stop their lives the first Tuesday of each month to honor a fellow student at Silver Taps, its a university where you can greet someone with a Howdy! and theyll say it right back, and most of all because above all else we are there for each other and that is shown day in and day out in most cases. In the past few days many things have been said about Aggies by other Aggies and it is downright ridiculous. To be specific as to what Im talking about, Im addressing the incident involving the Fish Camp which went to bonfire memorial to take its camp pictures. Now in full disclosure I have been involved in Fish Camp as a counselor but I also have a deep love for the bonfire and the history, tragedy, and spirit it stands as a reminder of. I would be lying if I said that the pictures didnt enrage me, when I saw them and still at this point almost a full day later it irks me to no end that a group of people who would seek to teach incoming freshmen of the traditions of this university would act with such irreverence towards one of the most solemn memorials on our campus. I will not defend their actions because they are indefensible and the directing staff should take full measures to correct the damage done, but the damage is done the hurt is felt and this cannot be undone. So as Aggies I call on every one of us to take a beat and instead of jumping on either bandwagon learn from what was done on both sides, and make an impression on the incoming class, that Fish Camp is meant to serve, that we as Aggies do not tear each other down but we build each other up and learn from each other even if that means putting aside our anger for the time being and teaching others the importance of the many facets of our university. I leave you with something said after the tragedy of bonfire in 1999 by the Vice Student Body President for the University of Texas Aggieland is a special place, with special people now I know its hard to say about a t-sip but he was right. Aggieland is a special place, and its through the love and acceptance we show one another, despite our flaws and differences, which allows us to continue the tradition that has been with us since the day our doors opened in 1876 the tradition of the Aggie Spirit.

Who the hell tries to kill themselves  because of a prelim grade? Who the hell gets depressed so easily just because a guy doesn't like them? GROW UP! Want to know what real adversity is?

I grew up living in a household with a total income of below 10k (well below the poverty line) and routinely had no heat in the winter and no AC in the summer. Guess what? I didn't cry or pout or get depressed. I worked my ass off and got into Cornell. I don't drink, go to parties or do anything that could jeopardize my future. Cornell gave me freedom to do as a please, learn what I want and to not have to worry if I was going to have food to eat that night. Cornell is an amazing place and most of you people don't understand how valuable the name, and education is. You should be THANKING yourself that you got into such a great university.  Now, go back and evaluate your life. How pathetic do your stupid first world problems sound now? You're not fending for your life in the middle east. You're not worrying about what to eat at night.

Drugs,"Justice served.  So last night after being a good little wildcat and studying all night, my drunk roommates come home with the munchies and we all whisk off to d-hop. Being the only sober person on main street is always entertaining and last proved to be no exception. No sooner do we sit down in mama macs to enjoy our pizza do my roommates dissolve into laughter about who even knows what, start loudly quoting movies, and generally making a (harmless, yet loud) fools of them selves. Naturally this escalated to gummy bears being tossed around and it was just about time to go. So this shout out goes to the BITCH behind us: I will sit there and listen to you complain about how loud we are (it wasn't Thursday night at midnight or anything) and how annoying we are (god who has the audacity to laugh these days?) and how immature we are (guilty, my roommate had gummy bears up her nose) but you mother fucker. I will be god DAMNED when you call them stupid bitches (only AFTER they walk out, mind you) if you think I'm not going to get pissed. But my real breaking point? You do not. call. my. girls. SLUTS. So listen up: First of all, get over yourself. You're out on a Thursday night at drunk biddy central of the universe stuffy your own grumpy little face. If you wanted a quiet dinner get your drunk munchies elsewhere. Secondly, if you're going to say something, say it to they're face and not as they walk out the door. I'm sorry you're a pussy; grow some balls. Third, before you call someone who is wearing jeans, sperry's, and a sweatshirt a slut, maybe you should adjust your miniskirt and tiny tank top so you little 12 year old bits fall out. No one wants to see your pathetic A-cups. Which brings me to the next point; I'm really, REALLY sorry that the only guy that wants to go out with you looks like an anorexic 8 year old prep punk, and when he tell me that I should get my 'ass in the gym', yeah.

Many cases are different and should a woman have to carry to term even if it means there is a very small chance she won't make it?

So the handful of people in my major that I hang with all know now, and i'm writing the rest of this update with the assumption they're going to see it. This is also probably my last update (on this topic at least, you might see more of me in the future...)  I have not heard that anyone has told him about these confessions, nor has he mentioned it to any of those guys we are mutual friends with. So I assume either he hasn't seen it, or he's too fucking vain to think that any girl wouldn't be interested in him.   So let me spill all the little deets I left out before just so this twat can't possibly mistake this for someone else.   Telling me you've got old material from this course that you'll email it to me if I text you my email address is hands down the lamest way to score my digits. It didn't fool me. But I really wanted those old homeworks because that shit takes forever.  Asking me what my father does just to use it as an opportunity to tell me about your dad is fucking weird. Like I get now that you clearly have some serious daddy issues. It doesn't impress me that your father is some hot shot lawyer from some podunk town in the middle of buttfuck nowhere Texas. I really don't get where you were going with that.   You car is ugly. Every fucking daddy's boy has a souped up mustang. The fact that you clearly expected such a sweet ride to impress me, to the point that you were showing me pics on your phone, is gay. What was I supposed to say, Like. OMG. Your car is soooooo cool, your dick must be huge! I mean really....come on bro... lifted truck or gtfo...  If you actually thought paying for my meal was going to get you in my pants you're sorely mistaken. After all that shit you pulled during the meal no girl is ever going to mistake you for a gentleman. Not to mention I ordered one of the cheapest things on the menu. I don't think even a back alley crack whore is going to put out for $7.99 plus tax and tip.   Speaking of tip, who the fuck leaves that little? I've never been a waiter, but I know how hard it is to do what they do and I never leave less than 15%. You left barely a dollar on a 20 dollar meal. You're a fucking cunt.   A huge goddamn thundercunt.   You are so functionally retarded on every level I'm shocked you've managed to make it this far without getting shanked by someone.   I mean really, I get that boys have their little bro chats, but that talk should never ever ever make it back to the girl in question.  Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that a rather large group of males my age thinks I have a great set of tits. Ain't nothing wrong with that, tits are great, it's not like you can motorboat a personality.   But the fact that you, a guy who attempted to have some kind of relationship with me, brought this up in front of them is creepy as fuck. That and the fact that at least a few of these people liked me way more than they liked you and came and told me all about this. Nobody wants a dude that kisses and tells, or in your case misses and tells.  And finally dude. Get over it. You had your chance, and you fucked up. You done fucked up big. You're not going to get a second chance. So stop trying to talk to me. Stop sitting behind me in class, I can feel your creepy little caca brown eyes on me (you're trippin if you think those are hazel brah.). And stop telling people we're cool. We're not cool. We're never gonna be cool.  I'm serious about this being my last update. I don't foresee this getting beyond petty little gossip behind my back and being a creeper. Boys are stupid, and some are weird as fuck. Either he's going to figure that out or not. And either way it's pointless for me to harp over every stupid thing he does.

I dropped my friend at 2nd street and stood next to the traffic pole a few yards away to cross the street when a large bottle full of some white liquid exploded at the base of the pole right next to my feet. I didn't know how to react. I just turned around and some drunk man standing outside the bar was staring at me mumbling/yelling I wanna talk to you. It was in public and there were two people with him, also staring at me, but apparently I that was a common ritual of introduction for drunks on Bowery. I stopped looking at him because I think it was making him want to approach me and when the light finally turned green I walked away. Also, and this makes me feel like garbage, I saw a piece of shit on his phone forcibly dragging his senile dachshund whose fur is patched and gray by the neck (dog is audibly choking 'cause it can't walk that fast). No one around me stopped to pay any heed and I didn't stop him because I didn't want to piss the guy off and have him take out that anger on the animal he so obviously abuses on a daily basis. Beyond calling the police or taking the animal away from the guy, I didn't know how to help, and I can't imagine the man would've been penalized if I had called any authorities. Should I have taken a video of the dog to show them? Would they have believed me? I felt completely unable to help the bugger. So I feel like a shitbag who is also afraid to walk the streets. These men, by the way, were unintimidating (prior to suggesting assault), average looking, not homeless and not apparently crazy on busy streets full of witnesses. That terrified me.

You don't want to eat anymore. You feel tired and afraid at the same time.   In other words, conditions are perfect. Why? Because this is when success happens.  Success is not going to be rolled out to you on a red carpet. You have to take it, cling to it and run with it and never look back.   Maybe you weren't the best student this semester. Maybe you goofed off when you should have studied. Maybe you haven't used your time wisely. Maybe you have broken promise after promise to yourself. Dont let disappointment hold you back. Today is a new day. Yesterday doesn't matter anymore. All you have is this moment. Forget who you were yesterday and be a great student today. Work extremely hard today. Focus today. Seize the moment today and you will be ready to face tomorrow.    You can have what you want. But you have to destroy your dreams and replace them with goals. What's the difference? A goal has all the optimism and hope of a dream, but it also has preparation and planning and pain. A goal is pragmatic. A dream is idealistic. A dream can't be reached. A goal is meant to achieved, and built on.   Set a small goal for yourself. Maybe it's to study for thirty minutes without checking your facebook. Achieve it. Reward yourself. Then set another. Rinse and repeat. You are on the road to success. That's all greatness is. As one hall of famer once said, greatness is not some big unattainable thing. It's many small things, done well, day after day. Work out after work out. With discipline and obedience.  Day after day.   This is your time. Raise that grade from a B to an A, or a C to a B.

None,"I don't understand. It's not often that I run into this particular situation, but it does occur occasionally.   To preface the situation: I was out with some friends at NG this past weekend. We, along with many other guys, would generally prefer to talk to cute girls while we're there. Typically start as a fun, casual conversation and if it advances from there then that is great. If not, it is ok. We proceed by thanking the counterparty for the nice conversation and say something along the lines of Nice meeting you, maybe we'll see yall around.  This past weekend me and my buddy went through the usual behavior of taking a lap around the bar to see if we spotted any cute girls that we could chat with. We did. I approached and asked about their glow 5k shirts. I started talking to the pair about what it was and the general concept of the race. One girl (we'll call her right girl because she was standing on the right) really hit it off with my friend. Started conversing well and they seemed to be enjoying each others company. My friend and right girl were laughing along and engaging each other in the conversation.   The other girl (we'll call her left girl) was NOT having it. I get it, she wasn't into me. I recognized it fairly quickly and I understand completely because I occasionally get stuck with someone I don't want to talk with. I wasn't pulling the well known I'm wasted so let me hit on you and let me see if I can put my man parts in you routine or anything. Just generalized statement/question to spark an entertaining conversation. Her responses were confined to a strict yes and no repertoire. I got the hint. At that point I  told my buddy he should try to wrap it up pretty quick to grab a number so they could hang out later and I'd made a lap. Left girl was then left there alone with her arms folded across her chest looking off into the distance without anyone to talk to.   If you're at a bar and you can clearly see your friend is enjoying her time in the company of someone why not just chat up his friend so she can be happy? This isn't a question of why she wasn't into me at all because I understand it happens. Every girl isn't into me and I'm not into every girl I meet. It's more like, if you see you're friend having a great time why not just chat up the counter party so the pair can continue having a nice conversation. Why go to a bar if you're going to be offended if someone comes up to you and wants to have a genuine conversation about trivial matters? Why ruin your friends fun when you could be entertained for a bit yourself?  Maybe someone wrapped her tampon in sand paper or maybe she genuinly hated all people. I'm not sure, but I hope that lady found a nice conversation that night.  TL;DR Why not just be friendly with someone so your friend can continue enjoying someone else's conversation?",426,535,325,13,21

That means (unless I am in Phi Psi) I must drink until I sleep (at which point one of my boys will assist me in taking more handle pulls), wear fuckloads of pastel, sail daddy's yacht, and slay box like Charlie Sheen. Oh yeah, I like sports too. Like beer pong. I do it for the kids.  ^All of the above is true, except for slaying box on box. And the yacht. I'm poor. Fuck you. Anyways, I'm actually old school. All about dating. Only ever been with 2 girls, but I'm not ugly. Probably a 7 or 8 come at me bro, I lift. People keep antagonizing fraternity men on this page. Sure, we spit game. We rail box. We tear that shit up. But only when ladies ask for it (usually from their knees). We talk about last night's questionable deeds just as much as girls.   Example: Waldo: Watup playa, did you bone Sally last night?  Sadam: Yeah man, sex was bomb. Waldo: Same. Sadam: Got some crabs though. Waldo: Same.  ^Shit happens on the reg (minus the crabs. Kudos ladies), and it's the biggest turnoff for guys like me. But please keep letting that happen. It's for the greater good. Never tryin to cblock a bro.

Mental_Health,"Hello CC! Most of you don't know me because I'm not a very involved person with friends and stuff. I usually keep to myself and if I'm lucky there is one or two people around I like hanging out with, and about 10 acquaintances whom I like catching up with occasionally. The rest of you all are just people, like everyone else, with the difference being that you are all either capable of having engaging intellectual discussions, or have some kind of charming skill that make you stand out. But I don't really care about these most of the time, I'm usually neutral about everyone around me. There are some transitional months of depression when I hate you all, everything you do annoys me and I can't stand seeing you around me. But then there are some times when you are all lovely, smart human beings who are so full of interesting ideas and are fascinating universes to discover. So, why am I writing all these things I think about you people? Who cares? That's a good question because other than one or two freaks who care about everything, no one cares. But you know what? I don't care if you care or not, I'm still writing this. Because I'm struggling like most of you are right now, life is hard and I want to connect to people. It doesn't always happen, connecting a large amount of people. I'll try. I'm at a point in my life where if you ask me, I absolutely cannot think of a single thing I would like to be doing. I sincerely don't want to do anything. I don't want to do anything so badly that I don't even want to do nothing. I'm sick and tired of doing things, but not doing things is also doing something. There is an effort involved with not doing things. I'm stuck in this floating condition. Everything I used to hold on to for my sanity are starting to get loose. Identity. Home. Friendship. Curiosity, discovery. They don't make as much sense anymore. Everything I enjoy doing feels like an artificial escape and they will soon slip away from my hands, leaving me stranded in meaninglessness. This sound familiar to you? I'm sure it does. I know everyone who is reading this has experienced this or is struggling with it currently. We are all human and this state of mind is a very uniquely human thing. We feel alone. I for example feel lonely as fuck right now. I know there are people who love me, but I still feel lonely. I see all the beauty of the world, but I can't get my heart to feel it too. If anyone tells me that I'm important, I matter, its not really news to me. But my mind doesn't work that way. It likes to dive deep into labyrinths of doom, with each dead end the terrible thoughts reflect and grow bigger, fill the air and drown any breathing creature that I've been raising fondly in my head. There is no real solution to states like this. I could tell you to go be with your friends. But sometimes you don't have friends. Or you do, but they don't give you that space of comfort. I could tell you to smoke weed or get drunk or do drugs, a temporary solution I myself sometimes resort to. But it just makes you weaker when you are sober. I can't give you solutions. If I could give you solutions I would solve my own issues in the first place. So writing this doesn't make sense because it is not going to help you in any way. I'm only writing this to show you that I, a completely random person in the midst of a crowd, someone you wouldn't look at twice, I am the same person as you. I relate to you, even if I don't want to. We are going through the same shit. And we'll be fine in the end, because if there was ever a solution and we could lead perfect lives, that would be a problem on its own. Or maybe not, maybe it would just be perfect and we would live and die in perfection but who knows: that condition will never exist. In the messed up swamp of shit we are all sunk in, we'll live on and we'll cry and we'll laugh and we'll keep being basically all the same creatures. And that's why I",450,752,501,29,48

Not bitching about other people or groups that you don't like With that in mind I would appreciate it if you enjoyed the satirical tone of the following passage. I would like to carefully deconstruct your letter. (my thoughts in parentheses) In response to #40. I just want to clarify its not just DG's that act like this . (really??? it's a shock to me that some girls that go to a 60,000$ a year private institution are stuck up. Also the center point of your attack hinges on the fact that this person was insulting DG, in reality they were just giving an example) Kappas, tri delts, and even alpha Phis are guilty of this. (EVEN ALPHA PHIS?!?!?!??!? nooooooooo) (also what evidence do we have that AKA, Pi Phi, Theta, and G PHI B also don't possess these characteristics?) And you wonder why the only girls I hit and quit are in sororities. (Anyone that actually says hit it and quit it, is most likely a virgin) Wanna know what my favorite past time is? treating dumb ho's like dumb ho's. (I like to disrespect women as well) anyways Non sorority girls are way more prettier and don't even know it. (Elizabeth Dillon has openings in her english 101 course, I suggest you check it out, it's probably way more awesomer than any of your other english courses) Sorry sorority girls but the sorority gave you a shitty personality and probably clymadia unless your a DG, than you probably never kissed a boy. (Chlamydia* you're* you've (or you have is acceptable as well), see Professor Dillon for more information) BUT BUT BUT, There are chill sorority girls that didn't let the sorority go to their head but only a select few.

Motherfucker jumps infront of the bike and grabs on to handlebars and I flip and all I can think about is  A. Who the fuck is todd? B. Why does he love this bike soo much? C.Damn that fire extinguisher makes a lot of fuckin racquet when it's launched from a bike onto the pavement?  D. Is Todd Kenyan? Cuz daaaam As I'm getting off the pavement a chubby girl in cat make up is standing right there whining and asking why I took Todd's bike , I am just flabbergasted that Garfield could cover 40 yards that fast. Next thing I know Todd's people are surrounding me talkin shit askin why I took bike then Todd shoves me and says why'd u take it , at that point I realize I am going to get gang raped by Todd n his cronies unless I can create a diversion , engage operation shock and awe. I pickup extinguisher and swing that bitch right into side of Todd's knee and Todd goes DOWN , KO bitches. Everyone takes a step back n sets down the flames n pitch forks for a second and I shoulder the extinguisher and say,  I'm just trying to find hometree and book it through the woods.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"My theory is that women can only pair bond to one male at a time and that is what makes them seem like a good woman or basically, its the pair bond that causes her to engage in a heightened display of positive qualities she does not show to others, once she has sex with another male she begins to release oxytocin and associate it with him and thus starts to form a bond with this other man. Compound this with the problem she is no longer associating oxytocin releases with her husband (as they're no longer having sex) and you have a woman who is no longer pair bonded or in love with her husband but has indeed checked out and is now bonding with a completely different man, despite for all appearances, being married to her soon to be ex.  Once they branch swing or have already undergone lengthy preparations to ensure the branch swing is successful as it appears this woman is doing, the pair bond is broken. In fact the pair bond is long broken before she actually commits to the branch swing, the pair bond was destroyed the very moment she started enjoying regular sex with another man, that is not just her body enjoying such an arrangement, but her mind too.  Whilst pair bonded to you a woman is a completely different person than from when she is not pair bonded to you. The cold indifference is a stark contrast from the loving woman of perhaps a month or two prior. It's the difference between her relationship with you in a pair bonded and a non-pair bonded state. I think many, many men can relate to this behaviour from their own experiences.  Many men have noted how easily women seem to move on and how effortlessly they branch swing, even after long long relationships lasting years, they seem to have this ability to easily find meaningful relationships elsewhere, whereas a man who had a long relationship with a woman typically does not find it so easy to just replace his wife out of the blue because things got boring, add a mistress to the rotation? Sure, but he's still there for his wife and he's still willing to fuck her. Men don't just stop loving you because you don't make them tingle anymore, unlike women. Men stop loving you when you stop displaying femininity towards them.  It's as if women are programmed only to respect and respond well to the man fucking them the best, if a woman runs a harem of men she'll love whoever fucks her the best despite who her husband is meant to be. If a man runs a harem he's still capable of loving his wife despite all the side pussy he's getting, he doesn't think oh shit this airheads pussy is so nice I'm going to leave my wife over it!

Excretions,"Third one in. Disgusting as fuck. Feel bad for the girl.  #3. Fucking freshmen right? Only a freshman would be so stupid as to defecate in his own bed, but on this lucky occasion he wasn't the only one in that bed.  It was four years ago and I was a young and upcoming frat star. And by frat star, I mean a bottom feeding pledge from PIKE. As most of y'all know PIKE is the best fucking frat in the nation and crushes more ass than a snow cone machine crushes ice. I was doing everything in my power to prove to my brothers that I belonged. It all started on an early Friday morning when a couple of pledges decided it would be a fantastic idea to pre-game for the infamous PIKES of the Caribbean.  At this time I was unaware of exactly what I was getting myself into. All i had heard was that there were three girls to every one guy, and that not taking at least one, if not multiple, girls to pound town would immediately get any pledge balled out. As you might imagine, slaying at this party was as simple as convincing a gator that they are good at sports. As the girls rolled in I knew I would start off easy, a simple gamma phi would do just fine. They swarmed like flies around a night light, and eventually the slaying began. However, shortly after the second sorostitute fell by the wayside, my sobriety also was well beyond reach.  It was about this time that everything turned black, and while the party raged on, including myself, my consciousness was completely fucked. I couldn't remember a thing. Low and behold, the next morning I woke up next to a dime piece DG, but was completely panicked. What awoke me was the horrendous odor that seemed to be caked to my body. As I looked down, I noticed this brown sludge caked to my ass and legs. Turns out I had been so inebriated that I had shat this DG's bed. Clearly I did the only thing possible; I grabbed some shit, and gently rubbed it on her ass, making it appear that she had been the one to shit the bed. After brilliantly covering my trails, I hightailed it out of her apartment doing my absolute best not to puke on my way out.  I have come a long way since freshmen year, but hopefully I will never outgrow soiling sorostitutes beds. LUHHHHH FSU",644,422,236,1,20

For the past 4 months or so, my roommates and I have been living in an apartment with a tiny ass bathroom. The toilet is really small and right next to the shower, so there's isn't much room to spread your legs. Now this is fine for my in shape, slim, roommates, but for my big fat ass, I cannot pretend it wasn't a bit of a struggle at times. I had to wiggle, squirm, stretch, squeeze and essentially do anything in my power to make the toilet work for me. This often involved using the toilet with one leg in the bath tub, thus getting my right sock all wet. The bathroom also got really hot in the summer and really cold in the winter, so I would often find myself either sweating profusely or shivering while handling the most holy of businesses.   So when I got home and sat on my nice, normal sized toilet, enjoying the angle at which I could now spread my legs and the tepid temperature of my home, I sighed.

Why does someone you find gross in photos, appear to be so beautiful in reality? Why is the person you should hate, because they have wronged you time and time again, is in reality one of the few that you love? Why has the person who you once defined as your best friend, seem to disappoint and betray you over and over again?  These are all questions I currently find myself asking, as, I presume, so do many of my peers. And these are questions I don't, and never will, know the answer to.   They say that everything happens for a reason. Well let me tell you, most of my life I've had a hard time figuring out what that reason may be. I've driven myself crazy coming up with dozens of scenarios, stories upon stories, but for what? Nothing. The truth will set you free, they say. And so I've gone searching for the truth. Sure, most of it has been internalized truth, but I've also reached out and made myself extremely vulnerable for many truths. And have I found them? Negative.  Unfortunately people are too afraid of the truth. They cannot bring themselves to tell the truth because they cannot face the truth themselves. And that's what gets us stuck in messes like these anyway. Maybe if I had told him I loved him sooner, we would still be together? Maybe if I fought harder initially, even though I was afraid, this wouldn't have happened. Maybe if I told her that her actions have hurt me, that she has been a terrible friend to me, then maybe we would be able to mend our friendship? She bends over backwards for everyone else, but why doesn't she bend over backwards for one of the few who is willing to do so for her?  There are some things in life we are not meant to understand. Some questions are better left unanswered. And that, my friends, is the ironic part. We spend our lives analyzing the what ifs and whys, but never actually spend it living.   We've come to rely on texting, email, facebook, and secret pages like this instead of having face to face communication. My confession is that I'm just like the rest of you. Afraid to claim my words and own up to the truth, because in all honesty, the truth is scary. It is painful to make yourself vulnerable and then get rejected. But it may be even more painful to remain silent.   #drunkenconfessions.   My goal: learn how to speak my mind. And I urge you to do the same. If not, our words just become meaningless.

Living here was predominantly a waste of time as none of the other houses on the street were interesting apart from a bunch of frat guys across the road from us, not to mention the fact that there was ZERO potential on the whole street, or area for that matter! But worst of all was the fact that we shared a wall with literally the nerdiest of nerds, it would have been a compliment to call these guys (and girl) poindexter, geeks or geniuses because they just sucked at everything. These were the worst type of nerds; PC gamers. What the fuck do these kids bring to the table? I dont know. They had no social skills, no personal hygiene skills, no skills in the kitchen they had no skills at all apart from perhaps 5+ years experience dictating over a virtual empire of dwarves and pixies.  We were a bunch of typical dickheads out for a good time wherever possible and giving college our best 20% effort.  So now you know the characters, heres the story.  I was nursing an incredible hangover and trying to complete an assignment to be handed in the next day while my roommates, the over committed alcoholics, were getting after it as usual. After much abuse about being a pussybitchsackofshitcocksucker, they left me alone to get on with it while they continued a standard Wednesday shitshow. After about an hour they were ready for town and I heard them stumble out the door. I had done the obligatory copy n paste from google scholar and various journal articles so my assignment was now a completed masterpiece and I promptly passed out.  I woke up to my roommate, Deebz, screaming at me from my bedroom door (which was actually just a few scraps of wood on hinges, the remnants of an earlier incident). Kev! Kevin! Wake the fuck up Kevin!! KEV!! KEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVV!! Im gonna shit on the nerds doorstep Kevin! He was pretty excited about this particular venture and had obviously run home from town to tell me about it and get the work done. Haha yeah ok bro. Go ahead I said, still dazed and half awake. I got up and followed him downstairs, amused by the turn of events.  Then, taken by a sudden epiphany I suggested Bro take a shit on this plate! Then we can just throw it inside their house or leave it on their bench! Of course, he could have just shit right on their deck or on their bench but I liked the idea of having it on a plate so we could take it inside their house and place it strategically under one of their beds or in their fridge. He was pumped about this idea and took the plate to the bathroom to do it over the toilet so it would catch any spillage. A true man is a thinking man.  A few minutes after this I hear an excited yell from upstairs; KEVIN! IT LOOKS LIKE A MEAL! IT LOOKS LIKE A MEAL BRO! KEEEVV!! I went upstairs to take a look and was met by the overpowering stench almost 10 steps away, working through this I got closer and lo and behold my roommate was holding the delicious looking beef lasagna he had just cooked up. It was ridiculous; it looked like a hearty winter stew or an Indian curry or something. I couldnt believe it. We were in hysterics at this stage although the smell was so bad that I was trying not to breathe which made laughing as hard as I was a strange experience, Deebz didnt seem fazed though.  Deebz then proceeded to take the meal off to the nerds for deployment but walking through the kitchen we realized we could make this a whole lot better than it already was. So, taking some leftover KFC potato & gravy and some broccoli from the fridge we lovingly prepared these extra ingredients for the dish. It looked delicious! (We took a photo which I will try and unearth but I fear it might be on one of my busted laptops which had too many drinks one night). So, Deebz took the creation next door to leave in their fridge or something but alas the door was locked, the nerds had gone out for once",740,737,413,1,19

It had a shirt that  covered its gargantuan stomach displaying a lone howling wolf. It had facial hair that only covered its neck. It saw my friend and I staring and tipped its fedora towards us in a ceremonial fashion.It sat towards the back and pulled out a can of Mountain Dew and what I believe to be, through my studies, a Nintendo 3DS with the sound on. The bus came to another stop. A woman walked in. All seats were taken except the one next to that beautiful, neck-bearded creature. She chose to stand. The beast then began to exhale furiously, its face reddened as it exclaimed This seat is open, m'lady in a very poorly done, chivalrous manner. She looked very uncomfortable, but consented, and in response, the beast tipped its fedora. The creature offered her some of its Cheetos, but she respectfully refused. The woman was wearing a shirt about God. The creature noticed and changed its tone into a disdainful, pompous tone, the shift was incredible. Ha it said nonchalantly. The woman did nothing. HA! it repeated. What is it? the woman asked.  As if God exists! it exclaimed. The woman did not reply and looked uncomfortable. It was happening, my friend and I had been waiting patiently for this creature to act, and now, it was happening. I read on Reddit that God was the root of society's problem The woman made the horrible mistake of asking it what Reddit was. Ha! it replied, Reddit is a forum where intellectual Libertarians like myself go and discuss pressing matters m'lady.

The bus came to a stop and the creature excused itself due to a pressing Magic the Gathering meeting it had. I have yet to figure out what this meeting was, but I believe it to be a cult.

But it's not enough. I want to do more. I want to prove to the world that not only are we one of the best universities on the planet, we are also made up of some of the most talented individuals from all across the world and from all walks of life.   For this reason, I have been working very hard on a new initiative that will be run under the banner of NYU Secrets. I call it NYU Secrets: Hidden Talents.   There are some outlets that allow people to show why they're here--but it's not enough and the fractured nature of the school does not allow the individual talents of our student body to shine.  This is why I'm proud to present www.nyusecrets.tumblr.com. When the time comes, it'll be nyusecrets.com--but the point of this isn't the website. It's the fact that it will be, along with this Facebook page, the platform for NYUS: Hidden Talents.  What is NYUS: Hidden Talents? It's a submission-based way for you or someone you know to get the recognition they deserve in front of an audience of 20,000 people.   Full details are on the website. I will begin posting on NYUS: Hidden Talents within the next couple of weeks and, if you're selected, you will be posted on both the website and this Facebook page.   I have a dream that this university can, when unified, become something far greater than just the sum of its parts. I want us to show the world who we are. I want us to no longer be anonymous--I want to use NYU Secrets as both the platform for secrets as well as the very real and amazing talents of our student population.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"#2415: My parents come into the city every week to see me and my sister, and they bring for each of us a bag full of usually perishable and homemade food that they have no other way to get rid of. Whenever we tell them it's too much, they tell us to offer it to friends, roommates, suitemates, people in our dorm etc., and I hate telling her that no one else eats it no matter how much I offer it. I hate that bag of food more and more every week because it's food that I'm so used to eating with other people and I know I'll have to eat it alone and throw out and waste whatever I can't finish because it goes bad. Coming from a culture that always shares food, it even starts to taste disgusting when I'm alone. Last night I posted a picture of a whole tray of food to my dorm's group page, telling everyone that I hate wasting food and that anyone who wants food should come get it. The first and only comment was How do I know it's not poisoned? It got a like. What the actual fuck? Offended and embarrassed, I deleted the post and threw the whole week's worth of food down the garbage chute, tray and all. I know this is the city and you should be wary of strangers, but I don't know what kind of asshole says that to another member of his/her college dorm community.

The lights dimly glow, scattering shadows about the walls; a violet wash of light cascades over a microphone stand and PA speaker at the back of the elongated room. Patrons line the sides of the space, bar at the left, tables at the right; the crashing sounds of the bowling alley next door fill the ambience in combination with the sounds of barware clanging around, people speaking amongst one another, but above all rose the amplified callings of an emcee from the rear.  KJs Sports Bar in Newmarket was where Mallard, Wiseman, and Edmund, the three oldest members of the comedy troupe I had just become a member of, were performing their standup routines, for the monthly competition that March, late Winter night. Mallard, as unpredictable as always, completed his five minute routine on the parallels of real life and board games; of course the Candy Land characters were drug dealers, and surely a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Card was used in the O.J. Simpson trials! Mallard lived in a six person suite on campus, along with Jameson, a quieter, but very witty kid, Wiseman, who eats, sleeps, and breathes stand-up comedy, and then a handful of friends; Edmund lived in the same building, but a few doors down with some other friends and members of the troupe. Mary, one of two females in Mallards suite, and me were throwing darts at the side of the room while Jameson and the others were seated in the front row of chairs at the back of the bar, watching the current comedian... who nobody knew, nor did anyone particularly enjoy. I was nailing the bulls-eye, time and time again.  After that guy had finished his non-memorable five minute set of jokes, it was announced that Mallard was the winner of the competition, taking home fifty dollars. There was a lucky feeling about us all that night as we left in high spirits we had won beer money. Mallard drove back to campus alone, stopping at a local grocery store along the way to pick up some booze. He returned to the suite to find everyone from the group plus other friends and suitemates spending time together in the living room, ready to celebrate the great night with a few drinks.  Being a freshman with a rather full course load, I only planned to enjoy one drink, perhaps, and then leave. I had a computer science class early the next morning I really couldnt afford to miss. Only a few weeks into the spring semester, I was already doing poorly in that programming class I had always liked computers, but writing codes for them was entirely another story altogether.  Oh come on, stay and leave a good impression with these guys, youre gonna be on stage with them for the next three years, I thought to myself. Hey, besides, if you leave too early theyll think youre a stiff  relax, drink a brew, then you can go back and sleep!  A few minutes had passed, and I finished a delicious Blue Moon with the guys. I stood up from the couch to grab my shoes and puffy, black, down jacket, taking the breath with which I would spend on good-nights, and see-you-tomorrows until  So, pushing up his glasses with a single finger, Jameson proposed, I know that Im not going to be the only person shotgunning in the shower right now. Tossing out cans of Rolling Rock from his back pack to the guys, one at a time, he called, Mallard, Wiseman, Garrett Edmund? Oh, why, no thank you, I choose not to enjoy alcohol, sarcastically replied Edmund, stroking the chin of his beard (which resembled that of Honest Abe Lincolns). I had a lab in less than eight hours and, I was already tired.  Dude, you said one beer. Its time to take off then, isnt it? Interestingly, I was playing my own devils advocate.

Some people aren't as blessed to have everything handed to them like most of you. I've met some kids that go to Blinn that work twice as hard as a lot of us at A&M. Some of them have families they take care of, work full time, and yet still go to school full time. Some of them I have met also had to work to support themselves in high school, and when you have to support yourself making anything around minimum wage you can't save up for school or put enough time in their studies to make good grades.  It really makes me angry when I see other Ags criticize those kids. One, because you've probably never been in their shoes to have to work and support yourself. Hell, I'm sure a lot of y'all haven't even had to work a day in your life better yet support yourself. Two, being an Ag is at the heart and having certain morals. Most of you who had parents who were Ags would understand that. If your parents are alumni then naturally growing up you would call yourself an Aggie. Why? Because you aspired to be one and loved the idea of being an Ag, having the heart and morals of an Ag as well. And point three, chewing them out or giving them crap because you don't think their an Aggie makes Aggies look bad. If some one told you who you could and couldn't be would you want to be like them? No. It just gives us bad rep and makes us sound snobby. If anything wouldn't you want to encourage them to come to A&M?   Just some food for thought.

Sex,"Hey Ags! Let's get something started here. I'm tired of reading boring ass posts about relationships and daddy issues and troubles with boyfriends. It's boring and doesn't make me laugh. So I thought we could do something to change things up! Let's post about our craziest sex stories. I'll start:  This happened to me last weekend. I'm dating this girl from my hometown who used to work with me. It's been great, she's funny and has big boobs. We've been dating since July and we're already in a sexual relationship, of course (because really, if you date a girl for more than 3 months and still haven't had sex with her, you're a beta and you should kill yourself because you're a bitch).  Anyway, so last week she came over to my place and things started to get hot and heavy. Now the great thing about my girlfriend is that with her blowjobs are not a rarity and it has been bad ass! That night I was expecting one, but she changed things up. She asked me to go down on her. I've only gone down on a woman twice in my life and both times were very unpleasant (you're tongue gets tired and one time it smelled like fish shit) but because I'm such a great boyfriend and I figured I owed her, I decided to take one for the team. So I go down there and it's pretty clean (it doesn't smell bad and she's trimmed) and start going to town on it. As I am performing my tongue starts getting tired as usual, but I persevere and then I notice her stomach doing some weird shit. It was moving a lot, and convulsing or some shit, and I've noticed this happening before during sex, but this time it was on fucking overdrive! She's moaning and grabbing on to the bed post and making me feel like a true bad ass, but then something happened that ruined all of it. I'm still down there and her stomach's still doing that weird convulsion shit and then out of nowhere her fucking vagina squirts out this fucking liquid substance all over my face and mouth. All of my pride at that moment was shattered. I was disgusted. I had fucking vagina juice all over my face and in my fucking mouth. Now, through my extensive viewing of pornography I came to the conclusion that she must have squirted. I always thought that it would be awesome to make that happen. It was one of my many sexual fantasies to make a girl do that. But at that moment all I felt was disgust and hatred. How the fuck do I know she didn't just piss into my mouth!? She grabbed me and kissed me and told me it was amazing and I pretended to be happy and conceal all the rage and shame. I'm still dating her, but I will never go down on her again, and if she asks, I'm going to do a shitty ass job. Now, to all of you (women) who are going to comment on this and say something like Well OP, us girls get your jizz on us when we give you bjs and we don't bitch about it Yeah? Well fuck you! The difference is that it is expected for sperm to come out of a penis, you anticipate it! I had no fucking idea I was about to get doused in vagina juice!  Alright, that's my story, let's keep this going Ags.",1070,590,368,10,28
Sex,"This is long, so bear with me. I need some help/advice/different view points on something. I'm thinking of going to see someone(else) about this to see how to figure out what is going on inside my head, but I'm really just confused right now. I was with my boyfriend for several years(3+) and I was saving myself for marriage. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to have sex the whole relationship. It was my faith-based preference that prevented me from doing so. I explained to him my sexual reservations and the reasons behind why I wanted to wait. We're both Christian, and we came to an agreement that once we had a ring and had talked to my parents(permission, old fashioned), we would go further(sexually) in the relationship. So he got a ring, and we set a date for our engagement(he was a planner, and i didn't like surprises--so this worked out really well), and we talked to my parents. A few weeks pass after having done everything, and he breaks things off--online at that. And you can say the sex was bad, or make a joke out of this if you want, but that wasn't the case at all. If anything, we were more than patient with each other on that. I realize practice makes perfect, and we were extremely compatible in a sexual aspect.   But my dilemma is that I gave someone something that I was saving for my husband. Did I love him? Yeah. But I'm kicking myself now for making a mistake that I can't undo. My self worth/self esteem is at an all time low. I had hoped that after three years of being happy and giving him EVERYTHING that he wouldn't give up on me now. I feel extremely naive, betrayed, and worthless. I need help. I've already gone to SCS, and the counselor I saw seemed to only parrot things back to me that I said, and tell me everything I want to hear, and that's not what I need. I need someone that is going to be straight with me and not tip toe around my feelings.   Thank you in advance.",1071,370,234,3,24

Would you buy a house that you can't enter? Or a car without an engine? Why do these ivory tower liberal studies courses even exist at such an expensive college? I feel that Cornell is partly at fault for setting these students up for failure with such policies as any person any study, but the students themselves should receive the majority of the blame by not recognizing what society is looking for in an employable individual.  Disclaimers: This problem is slightly less pronounced at Cornell because of our perceived prestige. If you happen to be an Art History or English major who had no problem in the job market, congratulations, but the majority of your peers certainly do not share your luck.

Money_Financial,"I dread going home to my mom during the holidays. She provides everything for me. She works hard for me. She pays for my rent, my utilities, and my food. But throughout my life, she has taken an emotional toll on me.   We used to have everything. My mom was successful private practice attorney in Houston. She owned 4 different rental properties along with our 3,000 square foot home. We had 3 cars, including a Mercedes-Benz. I had a Texas Tomorrow Fund college savings account that I knew about since I was about 6 years old. As far as I knew, I was set.   In the Winter of 2004, my mom announced to me that she would be closing her private practice and seeking a job with the government. I didn't think much of it at the time. Fast fast forward to my senior year of high school. We were living in a 2 bed room apartment, with 1 car, shopping at the dollar store. But thats not as bad as what I'm about to tell you. The most egregious thing. My mother cashed out my Texas Tomorrow College Savings Fund and spent it all. My college fund. My fucking college fund. I don't know where that money went. Now I have about $25,000 in student loans. All because my mom has terrible fucking foresight, and thought that I wasn't going to go to college. I admit, I was a bit of a fuck up. But did she really think that low of me, that she had to cash out the thing that would allow me to go to school debt free?   But thats just the start of the train wreck that is my mother and I's relationship. I hardly ever speak when I'm around her. I'm always so afraid that I might say something that will give her an excuse to yell at me or criticize. When she brings me around her friends, she always says something that isn't true about me. Like for example, a common thing is for my mom's friends to ask if I'm dating or engaged. I'll say no, quietly. But she'll say, he's waiting until he graduates (or something along those lines. Thats not true. I'm actively seeking relationships. In fact, I had coffee with a girl the other day. Which is a good segway into my next point. I'm afraid that if I get a girlfriend and it comes to a point where we meet each other's parents, that my mom will get upset because I'm dating a white girl. I'm half-black, half-mexican. She has expressed her disapproval of the idea of me dating a white girl. She has said things like, you can drive white cars, but you can't bring home white girls. This is really concerning to me. See, although I'm brown, I'm basically an oreo - brown on the outside, white on the inside. Throughout my life, all my best friends have been white. So I'm most comfortable around white people, and I envision myself marrying a white girl. Another thing that bothers me, is the fact that because I do have such a tough relationship with my mother, that my ideal girl ( a girl who values family a lot), will think less of me because of that.  I dont know what to do, and I start to think about these things especially around the holidays when I have to go back to her and everyone else with what seems to be a great relationship with both their parents goes back home. And I also think about the relationship with my mom think about getting married. I like the idea of getting married, but I also think about the intricacies that lead up to marriage, which include meeting the future in laws",1123,634,371,3,36

First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's messed up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up. Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie. I don't want to go into to many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so beautiful that I watched it twice. (probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy :!: went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it). Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home. My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to frak her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly. After we left, we all went to crash with my sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time. My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was messed up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips. Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh. A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",1175,726,471,2,51

He also told me that he told his dad about it 10 years later (by that time he could no longer do it) and his dad said that he and his twin brother were able to do it as well when they were younger (I know his dad well, he is a bluecollar type and would never joke about shit like that). His dad also said that he developed astral projection for a short time. His dad went on to say its funny that you were the one who could move objects, because your half-brother is the one that came to me 5 years ago saying he had astral projections. Keep in mind that these people are Catholic, conservative and aren't the type to believe in stupid shit. They aren't druggies and I have never heard them tell a lie. So I actually believe them 100% and am now questioning everything I have been taught in my life. Is this magic or some actual technology or energy that we have discovered or forgotten. I believe that people's imaginations are always based on things that they have seen or experienced. For instance, imagine and animal or being. I bet you that every feature of that made up animal is actually a part of another being or animal. So for that reason I believe that witchcraft and shit back in the day may have actually be a real thing or energy that people harnassed. We have just forgotten that technology or it is less common and looked down upon because it is so hard to handle. For instance, how were the pyramids built? I heard an expert say that if they were to have been built in the 20 years that they were reportedly completed, they would have had to made, moved and placed one of those 2 ton blocks every 2.5 minutes. First of all, with the technology they allegedly had they would have barely been able to move any block if at all. But I think they had a technology or skill that we have forgotten, or alien intervention, or both.

Behavior matters, not weight. 2.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"I'm hearing all this back and forth about the article and in the catalyst and I think that, honestly, everybody's a little in the wrong. Yes, the article could have been written better and shouldn't have attacked the people it did without first discussing it with them to at least present their side. From what I've been told, there was an attempt to get a response after the article was written, but unfortunately the article was submitted too late for the need for a rebuttal to be fully understood or completed. And, truthfully, yes, there are aspects of feminist rhetoric on campus that do need changing. That's generally the state of any controversial issue on campus, and we all need to be aware of that and to try to move forward to make things better. However, I don't think the other side fully appreciates all the things feminists do on campus. Yes, people may feel alienated by certain wording, but you have to understand that the Monthly Rag does its best in trying to inform and educate in the way that they know how. It doesn't make them right or wrong... it simply is a point of view. My point is, I get it, you feel like feminist rhetoric excludes people on campus. It doesn't intend to, but that's generally the nature of the beast. If you actually want to change that, you can't just write an angry article in the catalyst defaming feminism on campus. That will only do more harm than it can ever do good. Maybe, instead of taking the indirect approach, maybe get involved. Feminism on campus won't change unless you change with it and help to make it more accessible to everyone. So, take a feminist and gender studies class. Attend a FemCo meeting. Step outside your box. Yes, it will be difficult because oftentimes we are set in our ways. But feminists on campus want to work with you. They aren't scary, I promise. You have to be willing to take that chance and try to make a change because, I can't honestly say that you have the right to defame an underrepresented voice on this campus if you aren't willing to take the time to investigate what they do and why they say things that way. We are all angry, and everybody is entitled in their own way. The question is, are we actually going to do something productive with that anger?

But if I do that I'll definitely have no way to help them repay the 5-figure debt I've already incurred by the end of my second year of college. I'm trapped on the path I already chose. Sometimes I'm idly suicidal, because if I die the debt would be forgiven. But I couldn't do that to my family and friends. No, I've made my bed.   I know they want me to achieve great things, and I want to live up to their expectations, and my own. And I know their number one concern is that I'm happy and successful. But I don't think I'm worth the confidence they place in me. I think I'm depressed, but I feel as if I have no right to be depressed. There are people with lives many times worse than my own. Who am I to let such relatively petty concerns drag me down?   I'm stressed, convinced of my own weakness and inferiority, consumed by self-loathing for feeling bad over (relatively) nothing, and I just can't stop thinking about what will happen when those loans need to be repaid.   I stopped looking forward to the future a long time ago, because it has nothing good in store for my family and I.

Occasionally, I even hear some mumbling or moans like someone is trying to get my attention. TWICE I've felt someone tug at my clothes when I entered the bathroom. A couple of times my phone's gone missing and I've always found it in the same spot--in the bathroom near the toilet. WTF? And last Tuesday when I went to sleep I felt like something was in the bed beside me...sleeping alongside me. So to remedy all of this I've started smoking copious amounts of weed and consuming unhealthy amounts of alcohol. Now if I feel something, hear something, or see something I just start laughing and throwing shit at it, pulling out my dick and pissing all over the floor.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"I HATE IMPACT Camp and the majority of people that attended, and that were counselors. I felt like everything was superficial and fake. The first day I will not forget how offending it was listening to my ignorant BG Mom counselor talk about how bad Fish Camp was because there were gays, tattoos, and gauges. I felt like I couldn't talk to a single guy in the camp without feeling like a whore because there was gender segregation, and lots of it. They had like three bible studies a day(kill me). I'm not an atheist, but I just felt like people were shoving bibles down my throat. It made me so uncomfortable, and they placed the emphasis on guilting people into loving God and acting like you had to be a certain way to be loved by him, rather than expressing God's universal love for all people, as all sins are equal. I just could not stand it and coming to A&M that bad experience makes me avoid church, and I still can't even go because every time I go someone mentions IMPACT and how great it was, and I'm just like, that was the worst week of my life and my parents FORCED ME TO GO. I was hoping the christian community at A&M would be accepting, but all it is is superficial people that go to Breakaway and sing like they love God and then sin constantly while condemning people with gays, tattoos, and gauges  and anyone else who doesn't fit their stereotype as the right type of Christian. I wish I could commit to a church, but almost all the christians here seem fake, and even saying I'm christian to anyone makes me ashamed because I don't want them to associate me with those types of people. Oh and as a note to my IMPACT Camp, for all of you who thought I was shy and quiet, I'm actually really loud and crazy and goofy and fun. Y'all just never saw that because of how utterly uncomfortable I was, BUT my Fish Camp sure did! I made my best friends there, not to mention I'm a counselor now, so how about them nuggets? In conclusion, How about all you Impact Christians hop out of your bubbles and look beyond the surface to see people for who they are, and try to make a friend without bringing up God in the conversation. #JustSayin #SorryNotSorry",1468,409,242,4,21

None,"Heres a little(ish) story for you Ags  I have been single since coming to A&M (I'm a Junior). I'm not complaining, I'm single by choice; I like being single. I've got big dreams I'm working towards and it's going to take someone pretty special to really get my attention.  I did, however, meet someone who fit that description last year. I had a lab with him. He caught my eye right away, tall dark and sexy as hell. His voice was like honey and he had such a warmth to his laugh. I'm not going to sit here and pretend I knew a whole lot about him, I saw him once a week and we never had any real deep conversations. However, he seemed to have his shit together, like me. He was funny, well rounded, and very smart. I could go on but basically, if I wrote down what it would take for me to give up my single status, he appeared to match every bit of it. He is the first and last guy since my ex that has given me those ridiculous tingly butterflies.  Now, I've been told I'm attractive. I was a late bloomer so it's still a bit odd for me to hear but I'll go ahead and admit that I'm not bad looking. People also seem to really enjoy my company as well. I'm a jokester, I live on other peoples' laughter even if it's at my own expense. Here's the problem. When I like someone, I tend to get super duper awkward. It's like being tipsy, I can hear how stupid I sound, and I somehow just can't stop it.   Regardless, this kid still seemed to like me. And I will say that I'm usually absolutely oblivious to those kinds of signs but it seemed obvious. I tell myself it was all in my head, try to convince myself he didn't like me back but when I really think about it, it just doesn't make sense. He had to have been at least a little attracted to meI think?   On the last day of lab, I finally mustered up the courage to give him my number...which says something because I've never had the balls to make the first move. I just knew if I didn't go for it I'd regret it. I must have written my number on a sticky note half a dozen times because I hate my handwriting and it didn't look pretty enough. In the remaining ten minutes of class the panic set in. I remember him talking to me but I couldn't hear him over the pounding of my heart. I walked with him down the hall after class and when he turned to go on his way I grabbed his hand, placed the sticky note in it and choked out something along the lines of if you ever want to hang out some time with what was an attempt at a seductive smile but probably looked more like gas. He smiled that gorgeous smile and I spun around before I could barf on his shoes, almost ran into somebody, and made a not so smooth getaway.  Well you guessed it, never heard from him. Idk if he didn't like me, or had a girlfriend, or lost my number or what. I don't obsess over it, or him. I'm still happy to be single and it's probably for the best, but I think about it every now and then and wonder...and wish I'd been less of a pussy about the whole thing and just been more direct. Not having an answer probably bothers me more than the rejection haha.   There I feel better. Proceed with the quit being such a little bitch and move on OP comments ;)",1501,632,404,3,48

There was also a certain feeling you got just by being on campus, a really comfortable and sort of amused feeling. Something about social life here was so uniquely quirky and whimsical and fun to be a part of. But all of a sudden CC feels more like one of those douchey party schools than anything else. I meet fewer and fewer fun/interesting/weird (in a good way) people, and it seems like the general values of the average CC student have changed. I don't feel comfortable and I don't feel amused.

Death,"My dog died this Winterbreak. He was a 7 year old beagle. My neighbors recently got a German Shepard and the dog would constantly start shit with my dog. It would bark and my dog would howl back and my neighbors would always complain to us about it. A week and a half ago their dog jumped over the wall and killed my dog. I saw it all happen and their was nothing I could about it. That was the worst part. I went and yelled at the neighbors and they had the nerve to say my dog instigated the fight and claiming that their dog wouldn't hurt a fly. I was pissed. We live near a wooded area and I told my parents a wild animal must have attacked him. I didn't report it. I wanted to deal with this myself. A few days ago I watched their house and waited for them to leave. Once they left, I made sure by ringing their doorbell several times and not being answered, I injected a large amount of rat poison into some meat and fed it to their dog. I did this every twenty minutes with different pieces of meat for two hours and their dog ate it up. I watched as their dog became sick. I watched as the family did all they could to save it. I watched as their kids cried and their parents grew upset. I watched as they buried their dog in their backyard with a little cross on it. And you know what? It felt good. It was exhilarating watching the hope fade from their faces and it was even more gratifying seeing that dog suffer and vomit profusely. Even typing this I start to feel a rush of excitement.  I got revenge and it felt fantastic.  R.I.P. Otis",1564,305,168,1,17

Please, just leave.  I did bottle up those feelings, you're right. Here they go, this is my confession to myself, so I can get them out:  A great portion of that confession is a lie. You didn't just like me a bit and only at the beginning. You didn't even rant to me very often. And you definitely at the very least SHOWED me far more affection than at first after I told you to stop talking about your boyfriend. Calling every single night and falling asleep on me all those nights? If you didn't like me, then I'd have to say you were very good at manipulating people, cause that is extremely obvious. Then you'd talk to me about one of your friends being manipulated by someone else and feeling bad for him. Yeah, you did the same thing, but don't feel bad for me. I'm not someone you should pity.  I didn't show you I couldn't tolerate certain aspects of you. That's a complete and utter lie. I was asking you if you truly wanted to share with me what you shared, since you told me you regret telling me so deeply about yourself several times. You brought up this concern to me: It feels like every time I share something personal about myself or my friends you go into TMI mode, and I assured you multiple times it was not the case. In fact, I even reneged on my request for you not to talk about your ex since YOU talking about him bothered ME. Instead of this being something you could compromise on you turn it into something of a dealbreaker.  And lastly, this friend zone is ridiculous. I wasn't ever in the friend zone until about 2 weeks ago when you found someone to replace both your ex and what you wanted me to be. at least, that's what you told me. Has it changed again? Like everything you say? Can you for a second tell me the truth about something that involves me?  You know, I wasn't angry at you till you wrote this extremely insulting confession. Now I'm incensed. To me it seems obvious that you were writing it only to get it off your conscience, because you are definitely not telling the truth. And to be perfectly honest, I only enjoyed our conversations up to a certain point. Afterwards, it became a burden, a chore, I didn't want to, but I didn't know how to cut my emotional losses at that point. Now I can, thanks to you. I guess someone had to do it. You did it.  you know, I don't think I've ever  detested someone that I've met at Cornell. Not even close. You might just have stolen that honor though.  You said you still care about me right?

That is beside the issue, the point is that this very extreme passion we feel for being an Aggie would be nothing if it wasn't for the careers we're building here in Aggieland. I'm not saying it's wrong to be proud of the school that admitted you, or liking sports, but what if for example, Aggie future chemists were all so passionate about chemistry that they would spend hundreds of dollars in a Season Lab Pass every semester that would allow you to take a special workshop every Saturday where you get to do individual research at the Lab; or future geologists can go on trips and study a cave or a fault; future astronomers could go Saturday night planet hunting with the big telescope; and the money for these tickets could be used directly to improve resources and equipment. Maybe it's because I'm not into sports, but wouldn't it be cool if all our efforts and money spent on watching two groups fight over a ball would be spent on academic activities? All a game proves is that some people can run, throw, catch and kick better than others; and there's a luck factor to every game too, even the best runner can trip, the best catcher can fumble, etc, and cause the whole outcome to change. Does A&M beating Harvard or MIT 56-7 make us a better academic institution than them? What if we put our efforts into beating the hell out of their academics instead of just their football team?

This is like saying Apples and Cats are the same thing, so surely since an apple is red that is why it cannot lick it's own ass like a cat.",1621,152,91,2,2

Drugs,"Am I an evil, vicious person because I am so weak that drugs have become more vital than water for me? To the point that when I moved into a room my best friend/ 2 previous roommates had available, that I KNOW I have casted a presence in which Drug use is so acceptable by mere justification. I had to bring drugs with me because I have become so socially dependent on them, the thought of meeting their other 3 roommates and getting people to like me was so terrifying. Well I shared some with my best friend when we went out on the first night, and after becoming intoxicated I mentioned I had them to one other roommate out with us, whom I just met. He was down to do them. I believe it was his 4 time with this particular substance ever, and he had never purchased it. Well it was no secret I was a daily user, but what kills me is he went from 4 total, to 3rd time this week, and he purchased them from my personal. He asked for more, tonight and I told him I was out. It is barely Thursday. My influence had him and a couple other roommates following my unintentional influence, an Occasional Weekend is one thing, damn even Every Weekend isn't that bad, but Tuesday, Wed, and Thurs, it took a long time for me to use for no reason at all, and they were so quick because I have given them an impression that it is the cool thing to do. I see it when they ask me questions, or they help me find something, or I tell them a story, they don't see it for how pathetic it is, they see it as if I'm some sort of big shot because I will offer their friends more and more money for their scripts until they can't say no, because my tolerance is so high for everything that I take that it's almost at a point they can brag to people about it, like if they were bragging that I was the best at a certain skill or sport. This isn't the life I chose, this isn't how I wanted things to be for me, I want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on things I can show for myself, or to better someone. THIS LIFE IS NOT COOL. If I could take it all back I would never have tried one thing ever. You will never realize how quickly and strong it takes over, and things will never be the same. I was blessed with a life that I can only describe as Privileged I had everything, and more. I had the amazing car, best phone, best laptop, an amazing girl, I would travel the country yearly, I was in the best school in the world, and I could spend money on anything I desired, I never knew how it felt to be broke and hungry. It all started one week day when my ex roommate made me feel that it was cool to take pills for no reason and to find joy in them. My use is apparent, there is no changing that, whether they think I have a problem, or if I do it for fun they are aware it is a daily constant thing. So I can't hide it from them, but I just don't want them to use my actions as justification or as a gateway. Do you think I am horrible?",1665,590,399,2,42

In what realm? Porn? Television shows? Don't women actively participate in their own sexualization?  Ermagerd slut-shaming, guise. Men are often shamed for having multiple partners by women and, to some extent, other men. I can think of only one current issue that affects women more so than men and needs immediate attention: rape. I was tempted to lump that together with other violent crimes, but apparently since women are usually the victims, it is in its own category. All that said, I think feminism has its uses. Just don't pretend you're oppressed; women dwelling in countries where women are treated as dogs would be insulted.  (Also, if someone could comment on what I've put in quotes, that'd be great.

I've noticed that a ton of recent confessions (pretty much the most recent 100-200) have been something along the lines of I wish I could meet more guys/girls. The whole P&B saga, while heartwarming and straight out of a romantic comedy, has left the rest of us feeling a bit left out. For the girls, where are the guys who notice and the guts to speak up? For the guys, where are the girls who don't brush us off? We are all posting vague one line confessions, hoping that something, or rather someone, materializes. We are grasping blindly at nothing, hoping to find another hand.  My idea comes from confession #9095. It seems like many people (guys AND girls) are a bit frustrated with the traditional social setting for meeting people of the opposite gender, and wish they could do things the old way. Asking someone to go to coffee/hike/whatever with you can be nerve-wracking. They could be in a relationship already, they could not be interested, or they could just be a jerk. The benefits, however high, seem to be outweighed by the risks.  Can you (The Admin(s)) pick a time and place for a convergence of everyone who agrees with #9095 (and #9106 by extension), to meet and greet?

Sex,"So I am reading a lot of stuff here about rape culture and the evils of men. I am a man, and I have never raped. But really, women need to take responsibility for this as well. If a girl is drunk and sleeps with someone, doesn't say no, then all the sudden the man is viably guilty of rape because for some reason the fact that she's drunk incapacitates her ability to refuse. However, if a man gets drunk, doesn't say no, then nobody stops to think that the woman is viably guilty of rape. In fact should he claim rape all he'll open himself up to is mockery. So all the sudden, we men have to be more responsible about not raping you than you have to be about avoiding situations where you can get raped.  And none of you women are ever concerned about raping us! I've had a crazy ex seduce me and continue to do so even after I told her 'no.' Was I raped? Some of you may say yes, but to be fair I quite enjoyed the ride despite the horrible guilt I felt afterwards. But in the end I let it happen. The guilt and responsibility for this was MINE and MINE alone. I do not condone rape, and I keep away from girls that I see are visibly drunk.

Instead it serves as a place for people to share their real (or perceived) grievances with others. Please do not take this as a criticism of GC itself, it only serves as a vessel for the words that individuals choose to share.  Whether your insecurity stems from wealth (or lack thereof), a perception that you should have gone to a better school, or a belief that people don't appreciate your beauty, charisma, wit, etc, there are simply better and more constructive ways to vent your frustration than online and from behind a curtain of anonymity no less. Please stop spewing hatred, jealousy and petty slights. It doesn't help you, it doesn't help me, it doesn't help anyone. It creates an environment so toxic and reeking of distrust and animosity that no HAZMAT crew could clean it up.   A) If you go to this school, be kind, and work hard...you will be FINE (monetarily and otherwise). With that said, never allow someone's material wealth to serve as an indicator of their self worth, or yours. Some of the most successful and influential people I have met in my life were not the wealthiest. (Holler at all my favorite underpaid junior and adjunct professors!) B) You're at an AMAZING school. Fine, so it's not Harvard, Yale or Princeton, but if that bothers you...get over it. You're here, make the very best of your amazing world class education, and if you really believe that you were meant to go HYP...then apply to transfer.  C) Those that don't appreciate your qualities aren't necessarily flawed or bad people. Everyone here is very busy and sucked into their own lives and circles, which is completely normal. Life is too short to give a damn what others (outside of family and close friends) think of you. Never mistake scarcity for value.  We as a school and a community are only as strong as our weakest link, so rather than acting like petulant and petty children, everyone that is tempted to write something hurtful, spurning or vindictive on this page, please stop and  ask yourself these two questions...Would I write this if it wasn't anonymous?

When she saw me, she asked if I had just gotten home. Yeah, I just walked home. Where are your pants? I feel especially stupid because before I left my friend's place, I consciously thought you're going back to your place, you need your keys, and unclipped my keys from my pants which were on the floor, but forgot my pants, and not once did I stop during my walk to think about how cold it was.",1812,136,81,5,9

I want you to consider for a moment what this school would be like if everyone had the same major and future goals as you. Maybe it would be easier to understand each other, and maybe it would be a little less frustrating. We would all have the same assignments all the time, so we wouldn't have to argue about whose workload was 'harder.' We would all understand each others' passions and interests, and maybe it would be fun for a while.   But wouldn't this also be really boring?! We would miss out on opportunities to see the world through a different lens, and through someone else's eyes. We might not have the chance to have our firmly held beliefs challenged by others with different values. We might miss something crucial when solving a problem because we would all approach it the same way.   We would eventually all go on to do similar things with our lives. But then what would we be left with? A world full of doctors? A world full of policy makers? A world full of businessmen (and women)?  Our strengths are in our differences. Together we come together to build something that is greater than the sum of its parts. As a community with different passions and pursuits we are each able to contribute something special and unique that the world desperately needs.  So here is my challenge to you. Embrace these differences. Open yourself up to learning new things from other people who have different interests. Follow your own unique passions and find a way to use them that builds up our community and our world. Celebrate the things that make each of us special and unique.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"#15138 I'm not 100% comfortable around gay people.  I am first generation American, born and raised by a traditional, slightly macho immigrant household. I was sent to a catholic school grades K-8, and my father is a fervent bible reader.I grew up in NYC, submersed in an urban, hip-hop culture which frowns upon homosexuality and uses gay slurs liberally. It wasn't until I started college and ventured into the world of academia that I started to become increasingly appreciative of different peoples, cultures, and walks of life.    Now, don't get me wrong: I'm all for gay rights, equality, tolerance, and acceptance. If you asked me a series of questions, I'd give you all the right answers any reasonable, just person would and should give. I can talk to gay people, treat them respectfully, and don't hate them in any way, or think they're wrong. This is not about how I feel about gays on a societal or ethical level. (I'm agnostic, and don't subscribe to any particular set of tenets.); this is just about me personally.   Growing up, I never really had much interactions with gay people. In fact, it wasn't really until I started dating my ex (who had a lot of gay friends) that I started being exposed to gay people with greater frequency, and I realized I felt a bit uncomfortable. However, I wanted to force myself to overcome this aversion, so I made sure to be social, and would even go out to gay bars/clubs with my ex and her friends sometimes. I figured the more I expose myself to being around gay people, the quicker I'll get over myself. Unfortunately, even after all that, and even after many other subsequent interactions with gay people, I still don't feel fully comfortable around them. The fact that I'm what some would consider a good looking metrosexual doesn't really help either, because often times my interactions with gay people result in them hitting on me, which only causes me to withdraw back into my comfort zone.  I used to think I was the only one, but the more I think about it, the more I find it hard to believe. Society as a whole has spent literally thousands of years admonishing homosexuality in one way or another, and to think that a people can just wake up one morning and be 100% We love gays! after just a few decades of progressive movements, reality shows, and pride parades seems implausible. Like any evolution, there has to be a transition. Perhaps...I represent that transition. Is that wrong?  I guess what I'm saying is that, my upbringing has instilled me with a certain bias; while I know better now, and have made great strides to overcome such a silly predisposition, it's difficult for me to completely erase this vestigial bias, and I just wonder...will I ever? Furthermore, I wonder if the feeling of discomfort I get around gays isn't caused by them directly, but rather, the dissonance experienced as my mind tries to wipe out my senseless, vestigial prejudice. Before you point fingers though, ask yourself: are you 100% comfortable around ALL kinds of people and walks of life? Accepting and tolerant, sure; but what about comfortable? Then again, so long as you support people's rights and causes, does you being comfortable even matter? Or is comfort a level of acceptance that's unnecessary? It may not matter on a societal level, but I'm trying to be the best person I can be, so I guess on a personal level, to me it does...  In any case, while it may be too late for me, I'll be sure to avoid instilling such bias in my own children, so they don't have to deal with the same foolish discord.",1822,632,369,6,38

None,"#15219  I can't help but notice that a large portion of the posts on here involve loneliness and/or a lack of confidence. As someone who's been down this road before, I'm going to be frank; let me help some of you lovable losers out: a gym, money, and some kind of showy hobby you excel at will solve most of your problems.   A gym will make you better looking, which will get you more opportunities to socialize (sad, but true--the better looking you are, the more people will want to be around you) and interactions with the opposite sex. It will also make you more confident, so you'll carry yourself better, and together with more opportunities to socialize, you'll become less socially awkward, and eventually become an unstoppable social juggernaut.  Money will let you make the most out of your social interactions, take girls out on nicer dates, and dress better. That's right dorks--style matters. The easiest way to go about this is to get a job, but some of you trust fund babies probably already have your parent's credit cards on hand--put it to good use.  A hobby your good at gives you easy common grounds to meet people and makes you more interesting. Excelling at the hobby is important, because no matter what, you always have something you can fall back on that paints you in a dominant light and allows you to work/display yourself from a position of strength. A wise saying my uncle once told me, loosely translated to English: The rooster is boldest in his coop.  I realize this stuff is largely superficial, but that's really all that's missing for most of you--style, confidence, and social skills. You're at Cornell because you're smart. Guess what?

You might not be familiar with Texas World Speedway, but if you are, there's a scumbag real estate mogul out there who wants to tear it down to build another cookie cutter development in its place. TWS is a truly historic venue and hosts 1/8 mile drag racing every other Wednesday night when daylight savings time goes away to give us more light. In addition, there's a full infield race track where performance driving classes are hosted. It's central to Dallas, Houston, and Austin, which makes it real easy for anyone to book events there, especially since there's no professional racing circuit or members-only time slots to work around.  Whether or not you've ever been here, would you rather have a year-round-fully-booked race track, or another development with some offices, an elementary school, and a few hundred million dollars of tax money going to develop all the utility infrastructure for it?

Mental_Health,"I don't know how I feel about trigger warnings (not just on confessions, but everything). I understand that minimizing harm to somebody else's mental health is ideal but once you leave CC and the comfort of the community that is super cautious about hurting other people's feelings, the real world knocks the wind out of you. I do not mean to sound cynical and scary and dark but the reality is that the world outside of CC can be mean and insensitive and triggering in every way you can imagine. Maybe its not intentional but you will hear and experience things that will bring up terrible memories, insecurities, or tendencies. I understand that CC tries to foster a healthy environment but when I left I found that by pushing aside my problems, my fears, my disorders..for 4 years, I was only hurting myself. I'm just now facing them head on for the first time and its so difficult to do when you're trying to financially support yourself and create a life. I'm not saying we should all be cruel to one another and post terrible things just so students will develop a thicker skin...what I'm suggesting is that CC students have the hard conversations about the hard things in their lives while they're at CC. Utilize that supportive community not as a blanket to hide under, but as a pillar of strength to face your issues. People say you should wait until you're ready but what if you're never ready? When else are you going to live in as wonderful a community/environment as CC? Don't wait until your issues come to you because when they do you won't know how to handle the triggers and it'll be so much harder to deal with alone.",1932,297,174,13,11
Sex,"I am the least likely guy anyone would ever expect to be addicted to porn, but I was addicted to it in a crazy, crazy, crazy way, since I was about fifteen. At the peak of my addiction, I watched about 15 videos a day and jerk off every. single. time - before class, once I got home, but most importantly, right before I went to sleep. I would cum in about 30 seconds for the first time, normally, already having switched through 3 videos. Watching porn was habit, routine, normal. Because it was so normal, I'm not entirely sure as to why I was driven to do it, but I think it was driven by my smaller than average penis size and a complete lack of self esteem, having been bullied all through elementary and middle school. Today marks the day where I've been off porn for a whole year. Since then, things have changed. A lot. I lost my virginity last semester. For the first time, I can say that I have experienced intimacy in a relationship. I pick up on signals so, so much better. I have realized and am gradually accepting that a majority of women actually do find me attractive.

None,"So I don't understand what happened. We were together for years. You were by my side for all the shitty relationships I went through, and I was there for yours. I don't know why it took me until we were both 17 to make the best decision of my life: to ask my best friend to be something more. You were funny; always a joy to be around. Your outgoing behavior and awesome personality always put a smile on my face. Beautiful in every way; you told me I said that too much, but I felt I couldn't say it enough. You were smart, charming, athletic, and sweet. The first time I heard you curse several months into our relationship... those are memories it hurts to think about now. I mean, when I think about it, thing were just about perfect between us. We never really had a legitimate fight in the years we spent together.   So why did I have to be so dumb?  I thought a long distance relationship would hurt us. That's what I was told anyway... I went to A&M, while you stayed and went to a local college. I thought it would be better if we retained our friendship by letting our love lives go... I didn't want to see you hurt, that was all. I texted infrequently, but tried not to make it daily, as I did not want you to become too attached while gone. In reality, I, too, was afraid of being the pain associated with keeping in touch with someone I loved, but would not be able to see in person except once every 2 or 3 months.   Originally, I thought I would propose. Yes, it seems dumb, as we only dated a year and a half, but this way I could keep you with me forever. You legitimately made me happy, a rare feeling for me, and all I wanted was to be the same to you. Yet, at the same time, it didn't seem the right thing to do... for a number of reasons. So in the end, I simply came here. It took me a solid week before I called, but you have to believe I wanted to do it every single day. You seemed so happy when you heard from me that it actually hurt me. Despair followed, which made me message you less and less, knowing that you may be just as hurt as I was by this schism between us... and as I had always told you, the last thing I wanted to do was hurt you.  We finally started slowly sinking back to the friends-only routine... sending funny pics, complaining about tests, and whatever else college was like; the same as we used to do all the time, except without the I love you's everywhere. It wasn't daily or anything... it was frequent though. Not a day went by that I did not think of you though. Then I finally mentioned in November that I would be heading home for the first time for Christmas Break, and you were so excited. You were the one who said that we should go eat lunch together, just to catch up.   ...so what happened? Why do you hate me?  Due to finals, about a week went by that I didn't get a hold of you, and I figured for the same reasons, you didn't contact me either. But as soon as I returned home, I couldn't get a hold of you.  A few days passed, and I stopped calling and simply texted asking about our lunch plans. ...that's when you told me you wanted nothing to do with me. You told me to stay out of your life; that I needed to just accept that we were nothing and to move on.   I know I screwed up by leaving you. I never really said it, but we both knew it was happening when I left. That was the worst mistake I've made in my college career. But I still don't understand.  I let it drop for a month. I figured something may have been going on within your family, or perhaps just a bad round of finals. But when I finally got a hold of you again late January, you shut me out. You told me never to talk to you again. Out of the blue. No explanation, no anything. You just said you've moved on, and it's time for me to as well.  There never was any closure.

I had times in my life when I weighed much more, and hated my body, but my current boyfriend loved me and supported me at every weight. I asked him one morning why he loved the way I looked even though I hated it and he responded simply: I like women, not models. How are we supposed to grow old together if you spend your 20s starving yourself? Girls, there are men and women who will love you even if there is a little extra to love, and will be your rock rather than the anchor weighing you down. This is no longer the era where girls should aspire to look like hangers wearing clothes, or skeletons with skin. Aspire to run faster, swim farther, and be in shape, regardless of how much you weigh or what your size is. Be athletic. Have a booty. Love your hips. Find a guy or girl who will lift you up while you get your weight down, rather than use your fears against you. I might die never having fit into a size zero or one, but I will live long enough to bear children, and have the energy to teach them how to play soccer, or swim because I am healthy. I am athletic. I have a booty. I am a woman, and my man has loved me always. You won't find better until you recognize you deserve better. So stop being girls. Stand up, and be women.",1955,350,209,17,23

You invite him to your parties. You listen to his problems. You do all this because you think he wants to be your friend.  But then, then comes the fateful moment where you find out that all this time, hes only seen you as a potential girlfriend. And then if you turn him down, he may never speak to you again. This has happened to me time after time: I hit it off with a guy, and, for all that Ive been burned in the past, I start to think that this one might actually care about me as a person. And then he asks me on a date.  I tell him how much I enjoy his company, how much I value his friendship. I tell him that I really want to be his friend and to continue hanging out with him and talking about our favorite books or exploring new restaurants or making fun of avant-garde theatre productions. But he rejects me. He doesnt answer my calls or e-mails; if wed been making plans to do something before this fateful incident, these plans mysteriously fail to materialize. (This is why I never did get around to seeing the Hunger Games movie. Not to name any names, but thanks a lot, Tom.) Later, when I run into him at social events, our conversations are awkward and lukewarm. This is because the moment we met, he put me in the girlfriend-zone, and now he cant see me as friend material.  I must say that I find this really unfair. I mean, Im a nice girl. I have a lot to offer as a friend, like not being a douchebag and stuff. But males just dont want to be friends with nice girls like me. They cant help it, I guess; its just how theyre wired, biologically. Evolution conditioned our male hominid ancestors to seek nice girls as mates and form friendship bonds only with the other dudes that they hunted mammoths with. Its trueI know this because I studied hominids in my fifth-grade science class.  So whats the answer? Should I take up mammoth-hunting in an attempt to appeal to the friendship centers of mens primal lizardbrains? Should I keep making guy friends and then prevent them from making a move on me by subtly undermining their self-confidence? Should I just give up on those manipulative, game-playing, two-faced bastards once and for all? I dont know. I mean, Id really like to have a true friendship with a guy someday, but its so hard to trust and respect them when they never say what they meanand you never know when you might be relegated to the girlfriend-zone.",1958,489,296,16,20

So a few weeks ago I was getting fed up with class and decided to let out some steam by going out on College Ave and hitting up some house parties. I met up with some chicks from my floor and started pre-gaming. A beer and two shots later we took to College Ave. We got to the bus stop outside the suites and waited for the H. As we were waiting, the girls were starting to feel it and were getting restless. Eventually we got on the bus and made our way over. As we hit each bus stop more and more people kept coming on the bus as usual on a Friday night. Eventually it got so packed that I had this girl, let's call her Sara, with her ass right in my junk. Oh my god was it glorious. Every time the bus would turn or hit a bump she would take it as an excuse to rub her ass more and more into me. This fucking tease. God damn I had to try so hard not to screw this up. When the bus finally stopped at the RSC and she started to leave, she turned to me and gave me the sneakiest, bitchiest smile. The fucking bitch enjoyed it. Cunt. And off into the night she went. When we got off the bus I collected my girls and we made our way over to the first house of the night. We got there and lo and behold our ratio got us in. Five girls to one guy is awesome, even if they aren't the best. Anyway, we get into this shitty basement and no one is there yet. The DJ is at his table and really killing it though. I made my way over to the keg and poured my ladies some drinks. Slowly but surely the party started to fill up and a half hour later the place was roaring. Make-outs on the walls, sex in the bathroom, shit was heating up. I'm moving my way through the party and all of a sudden BOOM! Sara appears out of nowhere. I came up behind this bombshell and we started dancing. She was grinding so much it was all I could do not to get hard. At this point she hasn't seen my face, she's just dancing like a regular thing and then she saw my face. And she smiled. That bitch smiled and she only started to tease me more. Things slowly started to heat up and then we started kissing. Softly at first and then more and more as each minute passed. Eventually she pulled me close and said Let's get out of here. I followed her upstairs and we wound up in some kid's bedroom. She slowly started to undress, her top first and then she came to me. Grabbing my belt she whispered to me Baby, I'm going to give you the best time you've ever had. Trying to be smooth I whispered back Oh yeah, and what can I give you?

Money_Financial,"UNH Dining  Again on the UNH Dining topic; there should be a tiered dining plan offered where the first 50 swipes cost (like, I don't knoww) $9, the next 50 swipes cost $8 each, the next 50 cost $7 each, and so on. This would make it so that you would be counting up instead of counting down and possibly wasting swipes. If the cost of dining diminished the more you went, then you would probably be more likely to justify it to yourself to go over into that next tier. This way the university is making more money than they would had you stopped once you ran out, plus it costs that much less and it is easier to justify to yourself to go, and best of all, you don't need to buy a bunch of swipes when you run out towards the end of the semester.  p.s. is it bad that I post my good ideas here because if I posted them under my name people wouldn't take them seriously?",2021,172,106,7,3

I clicked it. The page refreshed. NYU Secrets. 0 Likes. November 27th, 2012.  I didn't expect anything to happen. When some people liked it and got the number to fifty, I was ecstatic.   Then came the act that, though probably inconsequential in the scheme of things for him, was intrinsic to the success of this page. NYU Memes shared the page. A couple of clicks--that was all it took for him to share. But it meant the world to someone like me.   It exploded. Overnight, I received the secrets of hundreds of my peers. I didn't know what to do. I had to wing it. I had no precedent. There was no one I could ask for advice, no textbook I could open for instructions. I've been winging it since day one.   365 days, 3319 Secrets, and 19,230 Likes later, we're here. Not just me, but all of us. You've trusted me with tens of thousands of your secrets, and I won't break that trust. These are secrets I'll take to the grave. There are some of you who treat me like a diary and I'm okay with that. I may not post everything you send, but the extent to which you let me know you all is humbling.   I have some ideas and plans for how to make the next year of NYU Secrets a year of growth--not just in numbers, but beyond this Facebook page. I've been in contact with several people and, if things work out, I believe that NYU Secrets can become something much larger than I ever imagined on this day last year.   Thank you all. We've laughed, we've cried, we've procrastinated endlessly, we've pissed each other off.

None,"I think people need to re-evaluate how they think about mental illness. People are born with a set of traits, and for some reason, when some one has a small fault, like say, they're really slow at reading, we call them slow or even stupid. But when you put a name on it, like ADD, the person is no longer stupid because their disability isn't his/her fault. Similarly, if someone hits your car and says they were drunk, or fell asleep at the wheel, we're all pissed off, but if they say I have a mental illness or I have a mental illness that made me an alcoholic, so I drove drunk we are all of a sudden supposed to feel sympathetic because it's not his/her fault? Whether you side with nature or nurture, most of your traits are fairly out of your control. If you categorize stupidity as someone who is slow to understand things, or has a bad memory, or doesn't have much information or is just ignorant, then yes, people with mental disabilities are the most stupid people. They are, in fact, in a special category for it. All I mean to say is that if you are going to call anyone stupid, then why would you say he's not stupid. He just has ADD. Or, he's not a criminal. He's just bipolar. It doesn't make sense.We have to realize that the only difference between someone who commits a crime with no good excuse and someone who commits a crime and blames it on his/her mental illness is that one had the money to go get diagnosed and the other didn't.",2057,278,179,8,5

Contrary to the Rousseauian ideal of the transparency of the general will to itself, we need to look beyond the most immediate and visible problems with Rice. We need to look at what is behind these problems and understand that Rice's policy of ushering in the beginning of an abusive new era of sexism must not go unchallenged. To leave it unchallenged is to condone Rice's grandiose plans for world hegemony, plans in which no one is free to say that Rice knows how to lie. It's too bad it doesn't yet understand the ramifications of lying.  Call me old-fashioned, but I'm not writing this letter for your entertainment. I'm not even writing it for your education. I'm writing it for our very survival. If Rice continues to hammer a few more nails into the coffin of freedom, I will be obliged to do something about it. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. The underlying message is that Rice's vilipensive modes of thought reduce principle to an expedient. No joke. Please don't ask me to destroy our moral fiber. I simply can't do that.  Rice's list of sins is long and each one deserves more space than I have here. Therefore, rather than describe each one individually, I'll summarize by stating that I have a hard time reasoning with people who remain calm when they see Rice transmogrifying society's petty gripes and irrational fears into issues to be catered to. Even without the dissolute ideology of nihilism in the picture, we can still say that many of the things that Rice's squadristi write make no sense. For example, what do they mean by, Doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty? Maybe reading that sentence backwards reveals a hidden message, or maybe it's simply the case that Rice likes to imply that the future of the entire world rests in its hands. This is what its escapades amount to, although, of course, they're daubed over with the viscid slobber of pharisaical drivel devised by its faithfuls and mindlessly multiplied by the worst types of temerarious, feebleminded whiners I've ever seen.  I mean, defeatism is not merely an attack on our moral fiber. It is also a politically motivated attack on knowledge. Whenever Rice tries to fortify our feeble spirits with a few rehearsed words of bravado, I can't help but think that it has conceived the project of reigning over opinions and of conquering neither kingdoms nor provinces but the human mind. If this project succeeds then pompous, obnoxious philodoxes will be free to renege on an incredibly large number of promises. Even worse, it will be illegal for anyone to say anything about how I deeply believe that it's within our grasp to take personal action and study the impact on society of Rice's greed, stupidity, hubris, and outright corruption. Be grateful for this first and last tidbit of comforting news. The rest of this letter will center around the way that it screams and cries whenever it's prevented from pandering to our worst fears. I contend that if it stopped acting like such a big baby, maybe then it'd see that it claims that society will benefit if it goes ahead with its plan to acquire power and use it to indoctrinate unregenerate subversive-types. That's like pulling up a plant to see how the roots are doing. It also proves that Rice is oblivious to the fact that its catch-phrases are based on two fundamental errors. They assume that a totalitarian dictatorship is the",2106,683,378,3,16

Judging them by essentially saying, Why can't you just be more like me? Can you for a moment empathize with the reason behind a persons negative self-image or standstill in their lives.

The first car that was slowly pulling left and out into the intersection saw me and peeled out so I could make it through before more traffic clogged it up. Right behind it was a Gables bus that decided to slow to a crawl in the middle of the intersection and watch me try to unsuccessful bang a hard, emergency right-hander onto College Rd... there wasn't enough room and I ended up connecting full on with the nose while the driver and bus completely full with passengers, looked on. My board shot under the bus and over onto the lawn in front of Morrill, and I became a human luge for a split second. I had to push myself away from the front left wheel as it stopped right in my face. I got up and out from under it, brushed myself off, the bus driver opened the door and told me to get on and give him my name and number and that the bus company would be calling me. Most of the girls on the bus were legitimately terrified and asked the rest of the bus what happened. The guys on the bus just replied with, he just got f***ed up!! For some reason I tried to give everyone a smile which just came out awkward. Anyway, got off the bus and proceeded to skate off to Murkland for class. Everyone on both the right and left sidewalks, still in awe of what they had seen, watched me skate away. Sat down next to my buddy in class and he asked me what's good. I said, just got hit by a bus. He said, that happened to me once: did a superman right into the side of one. You gonna get free tuition?! I laughingly replied with, well, it was kinda the other way around. Yeah, I could've lied and gotten free tuition, but then I thought, mmm bettah not.

I am focused on how mechanical my body suddenly feels and how bewildering it is that I cannot find a comfortable resting position. All of this is registered in seconds. Somehow I have enough sense to listen to the words leaving your mouth in case you expect me to respond. Internally I scour my brain for anything intelligent or relevant or appropriate to say but all that comes out is a nervous smile, a forced gentle laugh, a nod of the head. I hope you don't think I'm not interested. I keep looking over your shoulder, at my boots, at the sidewalk, at the passing cars, at the snow, at your coat, at buildings. And in that moment (even though its the biggest cliche in the book) it finally makes sense to me how eye contact can send a very physical jolt through your body if its with the right person, with somebody you admire, want. In retrospect however, I now recognize the jolt as panic. Panic or fear that in the few seconds you look into my eyes, everything I cannot say will be available to you and you'll do with my feelings what you please. What I really feel when we lock eyes is more like molten lava spreading through my body, starting at my eyes and ending at my fingertips, my lips. It is wonderful and terrifying and I hold on as long as I can until you look away, or I do. I wonder if you feel it too. Are we just playing a silent game of chicken? Do you stare at my lips the way I stare at yours, noticing for the first time, the shape and fullness of them? Are you momentarily wondering how they would feel on mine? Maybe you don't. Your mouth doesn't seem to stop moving. You keep talking and I honestly cannot hear you. I'm trying desperately to be in this moment with you but it seems to be going by so slowly through my eyes. And too quickly. Like water flowing through my fingers. Mentally I am pleading with any deity to stop us like this because I am afraid that this won't happen again and that I won't be able to experience fear and admiration and nervousness and happiness of this caliber ever again.",2284,506,311,20,29

You think your fake brotherhood sets you above me? You call these guys your brothers when nothing in particular even brought you together (besides a bit of hazing that you went through after you decided you wanted to join these guys. Big deal.) You share nothing special; no talents, goals, interests, etc. that brought you together (with the exception of certain frats that are restricted to certain majors, ethnicities, etc.). You simply decided one day that you wanted to join a group of guys that you couldn't even meet by natural means. I played football in HS. Busting my ass with my teammates every day of the season, going through hell so that we can go to war together on Friday nights. That's an example of a real brotherhood. That's an example of true brothers coming together and having each others backs to reach an accomplishment that we all seek because we share talent and interest. This doesn't apply to all frat guys.

Mental_Health,"My Confession: A couple of months ago I went through a major bout of depression. I felt alone, scared, and I could feel myself drowning but every time I tried to scream for help I felt like someone had put my voice on mute and no sounds could escape my throat. Around friends I was always smiling and laughing because I thought to myself this is what they want from me. I'm the happy go lucky one in the group. If I can't provide my usual cheery attitude than what do I really have to offer? Eventually my self loathing became so severe that I thought maybe it would be just better if I killed myself? I was so sure that I had become nothing more than a burden to those around me that I thought why do I even exist? I'm nothing more than dead weight. My very presence is a punishment to those around me. If I truly cared for them than I should do them the favor of ending myself so as to stop being such a nuisance in their lives. My self hatred had become so powerful that I thought the most productive thing I could do in this world was to terminate my existence. BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG THAN I WAS THEN! I have so much to offer in this world. I am la oving brother, an amazing son, a wonderful partner in life, a splendid friend who puts others before himself, and a FUCKING PHENOMENAL individual who is nowhere near done showing the world what the hell he can accomplish. And while coming to that realization was a difficult process it was possible thanks to the support and care of loving family and friends, a wonderful therapist who listened to me and never tried to belittle my experience (shout out to Butler Hospital), and medication (that while stigmatized) is so helpful because depression is a biological process and often times is best treated with a combination of therapy and medication. So I want to leave this message for those who are currently struggling with depression. YOU ARE ALL SO AMAZING, SO TALENTED, SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT, AND THE WORLD HAS ONLY JUST BEGIN TO SEE HOW BRILLIANT YOU ARE! So please don't question your place in this world. You are wonderful and you are loved. I love you. I don't know you but I love you because you are a unique individual with a special story to tell and I want to hear that story. So if you ever feel like you're questioning your existence please seek help. Whether its from a friend, colleague, or medical professional because no one deserves to endure the struggle of depression, especially not alone. I promise you that it does get better. I am a survivor and I know you are too. So fight and never back down and show depression that you are powerful and fierce and you cannot be defeated. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3",2336,504,308,16,33

And why are they spending so much money to send her to Texas A&M? Wouldn't it be easier for her and her family to do the two years community college then two years at a university like A&M? I love her as a friend, and I'm so happy to have met her and help her, cause I really do enjoy helping my friends when I can, but it stings and I cringe each time she makes middle school and HS freshman mistakes. I want her to succeed, but at the same I feel slighted by her being here, like my degree here has almost less value.

None,"This is gonna be a long one ags but I could REALLY use some advice right now sp bear with me please So back in my sophmore yr there was this girl in the same major that I was talking to and was really into. It was the start of the semester and I had just switched dorms and I had this new roommate who was a transfer. he seemed kinda shy and antisocial at first so being a good ag I was trying to make him get to know people and feel more comfortable. Anyway so one evening when im having dinner with my roommate, wild chance, up comes this girl i'm into and she decides to join us for dinner. And so we're talking and I don't wanna be rude so i include my roommate in the conversation and whatnot. We start talking about northgate & bars and going out on weekends and she mentions she's never been to Harry's, so I'm like Well there's a concert this friday so we should totally go!  and she's down with it and I'm thinking the perfect opportunity just fell in my lap. unfortunately the wannabe good ag in me had to invite my roommate- that was the beginning of my downfall. So we all go to harry's and we're enjoying ourselves, she and I are talking even more and again I'm trying not to have him feel like a third wheel so i'm being inclususive- Dumbass me because it turns out him and her are actually from the same area and so they actually have some stuff in common and all that and they start hitting it off. The reason i'm sharing this is, fast forward to today and the two have now been dating almost a year, and I've been friendzoned. At first I was cool with it but the only problem is that since we're the same major, she and I have seen each other consistently over the semesters- being in same classes and all, we've gotten close to the point that we're really good friends, but I also know now for sure that i'm in love with her. And this being our last year I want to tell her so bad!!!  I don't want to just be a douche and ruin their relationship, but I cant get over the fact that I pretty much led the love of my life into another guys arms, and I don't know how to just get over her when I see her and talk to her all the time. Like we text each other, study together, go eat together, even meet up on northgate from time to time. She's like an integral part of my life and I don't know if I can just cut her out of it. The worst part is she seems completely oblivious to my feelings and that's why I want to tell her so badly, but if I do i'm pretty sure it'll completely ruin whatever friendship we have and I'm not sure I can handle that. On the other hand I'm not sure I can handle not telling her my feelings any longer, what should I do?",2469,531,362,0,35

I read a letter today (from 'The Strangers Project') about a man dealing with the pain of having a wife go through a miscarriage, and i broke down--couldn't help it. I'm only 21, and thought I had a positively bright future ahead of me. I found the perfect woman, and then chaos found us and killed a part of us. What is this memory going to mean to me 20 years from now? Will it haunt me as it does now? What will I mean to her? The last time I saw her she told me that there was a time when she wanted to marry me--and i've wanted to marry her since our 4th date 2 years ago--but now she feels we're incompatible and she needs someone older and more mature. But the subtext was clear: she can't see me without thinking about it.  I can't think about classes, but I know I must. I am sad and angry at my inability to do anything anymore.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"Here's a confession that will make a bunch of people mad.         I have a problem with black people getting offended when people call them black. Just because you have dark skin color doesn't mean you're African America. That would mean that either you, your parent(s), and/or grandparent(s) came directly from Africa. You don't see black people in England calling themselves 'African Englishmen'.   Plus, why is perfectly fine for all Caucasians to be called white? Whether they came from England, France, Australia, or even right here in America, they are still just considered to be 'white'. I was born in Russia, and I will never be asked to be called a Russian American. By blood, I'm Russian, but by how I live, I'm an American. I don't need anyone giving me a title that reminds me I'm American. The only group that I'm okay with gaining the title 'American' as their race are the Native Americans because after all, they never left this land.  For those who call me a racist, the first best friends I had were black, and I think racist people are some of the stupidest people on Earth. Demanding to be referred as an African American is using the race card, and I have little respect for people who try to use race to prove their point. Whites are NOT superior because they are white, nor should blacks get special treatment because they are black.   Whether you're black, white, green, or purple you are human, and you gain my full respect for the fact that you're human. Right now, I live in America and know I'm an American. You can call me what ever you want, but it doesn't change who I am. I live by a set of principles that I always follow, and in the end, everyone is equal in the eyes of God. That goes for my God, and the other gods because I'm sure none of them are racist.   That's my confession, if you call it a confession. Just sayin.",2581,340,201,12,18

I had brought a book with me--it seemed like a great night to catch up on some reading for class. The night was long but it was warm.  So few people look up in New York, you know? I could stand on top of Bobst for years probably and no one would ever notice.   I decided to go back into Bobst around 1 in the morning. Things were calm. The university didn't need me.   The top floor of Bobst--for those of you who don't know, it's John Sexton's office. As I went to change in the bathroom and go back home, I saw a light flicker near Sexton's office. I approached the office and heard John Sexton approach the door--I hid immediately. He left.  My curiosity overtook me. I picked open the lock. I saw on his desk a manila folder. I opened it.   On top of the document: The 2013 Plan. I thought it was the 2031 plan, I said to myself. I kept reading. I couldn't believe what I read.  The 2013 plan.

Race_ProtectedGroups,"To make myself clear, I do not hate homosexuals and anybody who acts violently toward them is committing a graver sin than the homosexuals themselves. There are several admitted homosexuals in my congregation. Most churches forbid homosexuals to worship, but we worked out a deal with the four men and two women who engage in homosexual acts. They are deathly afraid of the hellfire that awaits them in the next life so we arranged to have them sit behind a curtain while the church is in session. Some of the older people are not comfortable, so the homosexuals must leave though the back of the church. Every Sunday we have an hour of praying away the gay so that these people will be able to hopefully cure their sinful disease and live righteously. We usually sing hymns and read scripture that guides them away from their disgusting acts. One of the lesbians has not been with another woman in two years. At least we've had one success. I firmly believe that this is the way that we should deal with the homosexual problem in our society: progressively. Some churches simply banish those people and do not allow them to partake in worship. How does that cure the problem? I suggest more churches embrace homosexuals like we do and help them overcome their disability.",2744,223,127,0,3

Race_ProtectedGroups,"#15280  The world should not come to accepting homosexuality as a norm in society. I wish people would stop treating it as a civil rights issue. No one is born gay. There is no gay gene. There are certain incidents in one's life that may push him/her to question their sexual orientation, be it a rough childhood or whatever it is. We were made to procreate.  It is only right and homosexuality is unnatural. No one can dispute that. For those of you who are unaware, homosexuality is how AIDS came to be. People can say why does it bother you if they don't bother you leave it alone and its none of your business, well it is my business because I don't want to be a member of a society where health issues in the future may become rampant because of our open-mindedness. Also, if they function as a progressive member of society and are productive and contributing to our well-being why does it matter if they're gay. It matters because it is a health issue. I think homosexuality is a psychological issue and just like all others, it can be cured. It destroys how families are supposed to be structured. Homosexual activists attempt to portray their lifestyles as normal and healthy. Hollywood and the media relentlessly propagate the image of the fit, healthy, and well-adjusted homosexual, while the reality is quite the opposite. Instability and promiscuity typically characterize homosexual relationships. These two factors increase the incidence of serious and incurable stds. Please stop giving these activists carte blanche. It is unnatural and unhygienic.  [Admin: Quit being a butt. Gonorrhea and herpes (cold sores) are uncurable STDs, and straights pass them all over the place. And if homosexuality is curable, why isn't homophobia and your obnoxious  misplaced concern for lifestyles that need less than none of your input?]",2749,313,180,6,3

Race_ProtectedGroups,"#15273  I am gay. And I have to admit, when I was first coming to terms with myself, I realized I was not 100% comfortable with gay culture and people. I felt incredibly out of place because I knew I was gay, but I wasn't comfortable with other gays. I had a plethora of prejudices about the people who shared my sexuality. I thought I'd never date a guy who was feminine, I swore to myself that I'd break the gay mold and be a jock that was awesome at whatever sport he did. I'd chill with the bros, love football, and be quite indifferent to all the gay hullabaloo. I wanted everyone to see and know that gay wasn't all that bad. I wanted people to see that gay could be normal. I thought I was purporting a better image for the average gay male, but it hit me one day. I was just as worse as the right most republican condemning any gay lifestyle. I was so uncomfortable with myself that I was doing everything I could to fit my sexuality in a hetero mold that the vast majority of society would find acceptable. I tried to suppress every thought and action that was too gay so that people would find me more acceptable. Well truth is, I'm not hetero. And i shouldn't be trying to force my sexuality into a manner that appeases the masses. Gay is gay. Whether someone is stereotypical gay or an unconventional gay, what does it matter? All hetero people are not the same, why should gays be? And who am I to judge? Who is anyone to judge? Every single person is different, and gay' is just one innate characteristic of billions. I guess my point is, no matter if you're gay or straight, acceptance isn't always something we're born with. So if someone admits they're uncomfortable around any walk of life, it doesn't immediately mean they're a bigot. People need time and exposure to foster understanding, even us gays, who most would assume are naturally accepting of all races. As long as we make strides to reach a sense of solidarity, it means our hearts are sincere. Sometimes people need time is all. So don't go shouting suppression and injustice if someone doesn't catch on right away. Instead, try to ease they're discomfort, show them you're a person as well, and our differences are what makes a unique beauty. Because condemnation will get us nowhere.",2756,414,237,2,28
