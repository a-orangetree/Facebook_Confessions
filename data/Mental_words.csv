i
feel
like
i
am
full
of
contradictions
i
don't
know
who
i
am
yet
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
deal
with
all
of
my
emotions
and
predicaments
when
i
don't
know
who
i
am
or
what
i
want
or
where
i
am
going
all
of
my
problems
boil
down
to
trying
to
figure
out
if
i
love
myself
or
if
i
hate
myself
do
i
feel
worthy
and
deserving
of
everything
in
my
life
am
i
capable
of
being
loved
should
i
keep
fighting
to
live
or
should
i
just
quit
most
days
i
don't
accomplish
anything
productive
because
i
am
too
deep
in
my
head
trying
to
answer
these
questions
i've
spent
hours
fantasizing
about
being
shot
or
murdered
somehow
i've
romanticized
that
thought
in
my
head
so
much
so
that
it
brings
me
pleasure
to
think
of
the
people
in
my
life
missing
me
saying
kind
things
about
me
at
a
large
funeral
i
feel
like
i'll
only
matter
in
death

i've
been
anorexic
for
3
years
now
and
its
exhausting
the
cycles
of
weight
gain
and
loss
the
constant
monitoring
of
what
food
im
eating
i
want
to
be
completely
healthy
and
i
want
to
stop
hating
my
body
but
i
cant
my
mind
wont
let
me
ive
gotten
a
lot
better
but
the
anxiety
still
persists
and
i
dont
think
it
will
ever
go
away
i
dont
think
caps
can
help
me
and
in
truth
i
almost
dont
want
them
to
i
just
want
to
eat
whatever
i
want
and
stay
thin
someone
change
biology
for
me
please

according
to
most
i
have
an
eating
disorder
but
i'm
not
exactly
asking
for
help
in
fact
i'm
denying
it
i
refused
to
see
doctors
anymore
and
i've
recently
gone
back
to
not
eating
or
taking
my
supplements
i
can
feel
my
body
shutting
down
i'm
losing
steam
and
fast
i
even
got
sick
tonight
and
what
was
the
remedy
you
may
ask
half
a
bag
of
pretzels
and
some
mountain
dew
i'm
going
in
circles
and
i
know
i
have
the
resources
to
help
me
but
i'm
petrified
i
feel
alone
here
like
i
have
no
one
really
to
talk
to
what
doesn't
kill
you
makes
you
stronger
i
guess
my
boyfriend
broke
my
heart
this
week
while
i
was
in
town
visiting
him
and
i
dont
know
how
i
can
move
on
he
cheated
on
me
and
broke
my
heart
after
a
year
of
being
together
he
went
running
back
to
his
girlfriend
that
he
was
only
with
for
6
months
after
he
repeatedly
used
to
tell
me
he
hated
her
and
never
wanted
anything
to
do
with
her
then
he
tells
me
he
hasnt
loved
me
for
a
long
time
and
so
has
been
lieing
to
me
for
a
long
time
i'm
so
torn
because
how
could
something
like
this
happen
to
me
i've
never
done
him
wrong
ever
in
my
life
i
wish
i
could
turn
back
time
and
that
this
would've
never
happened
where
did
i
do
wromg
i'm
so
hurt
i
no
longer
want
to
be
im
this
world
and
i
want
nothing
more
than
to
just
dissappear
i
want
someome
to
talk
to
amd
someome
to
help
me
get
over
him
i
need
help
before
things
seriously
go
wrong
i
seriously
hate
when
people
tell
depressed
suicidal
people
that
life
gets
better
and
that
it's
always
darkest
before
the
dawn
and
other
cheesy
ass
bullshit
you
know
what
to
them
life
isn't
beautiful
and
their
storm
will
probably
never
end
stop
trying
to
make
this
world
all
happy
go
lucky
and
make
it
a
better
place
which
is
impossible
there
is
darkness
in
this
world
let
people
fight
their
own
battles
within
themselves
stop
interfering

disordered
eating
i've
been
doing
really
well
with
my
recovery
especially
this
summer
but
my
friend
from
home
just
visited
and
they
tend
to
fat
shame
people
a
lot
i
tried
asking
them
to
stop
and
pointed
out
why
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
being
fat
but
to
be
honest
their
words
had
a
pretty
strong
impact
on
me
i
know
intellectually
that
adipose
is
harmless
and
i
think
it's
pretty
on
other
people
but
right
now
i'm
just
ashamed
of
my
body
i
feel
like
i
should
hide
it
lest
i
offend
people
like
my
friend
was
i
completely
out
of
touch
before
are
most
people
really
so
disgusted
by
fat
that
i
should
be
concerned
that
everyone
is
judging
my
slightly
above
average
mass
i
love
my
friend
but
i
think
i
might
have
to
stop
hanging
out
with
them
it's
just
to
painful

i
am

major
and

what
is
wrong
with
me
hello
cc
most
of
you
don't
know
me
because
i'm
not
a
very
involved
person
with
friends
and
stuff
i
usually
keep
to
myself
and
if
i'm
lucky
there
is
one
or
two
people
around
i
like
hanging
out
with
and
about
10
acquaintances
whom
i
like
catching
up
with
occasionally
the
rest
of
you
all
are
just
people
like
everyone
else
with
the
difference
being
that
you
are
all
either
capable
of
having
engaging
intellectual
discussions
or
have
some
kind
of
charming
skill
that
make
you
stand
out
but
i
don't
really
care
about
these
most
of
the
time
i'm
usually
neutral
about
everyone
around
me
there
are
some
transitional
months
of
depression
when
i
hate
you
all
everything
you
do
annoys
me
and
i
can't
stand
seeing
you
around
me
but
then
there
are
some
times
when
you
are
all
lovely
smart
human
beings
who
are
so
full
of
interesting
ideas
and
are
fascinating
universes
to
discover
so
why
am
i
writing
all
these
things
i
think
about
you
people
who
cares
that's
a
good
question
because
other
than
one
or
two
freaks
who
care
about
everything
no
one
cares
but
you
know
what
i
don't
care
if
you
care
or
not
i'm
still
writing
this
because
i'm
struggling
like
most
of
you
are
right
now
life
is
hard
and
i
want
to
connect
to
people
it
doesn't
always
happen
connecting
a
large
amount
of
people
i'll
try
i'm
at
a
point
in
my
life
where
if
you
ask
me
i
absolutely
cannot
think
of
a
single
thing
i
would
like
to
be
doing
i
sincerely
don't
want
to
do
anything
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
so
badly
that
i
don't
even
want
to
do
nothing
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
doing
things
but
not
doing
things
is
also
doing
something
there
is
an
effort
involved
with
not
doing
things
i'm
stuck
in
this
floating
condition
everything
i
used
to
hold
on
to
for
my
sanity
are
starting
to
get
loose
identity
home
friendship
curiosity
discovery
they
don't
make
as
much
sense
anymore
everything
i
enjoy
doing
feels
like
an
artificial
escape
and
they
will
soon
slip
away
from
my
hands
leaving
me
stranded
in
meaninglessness
this
sound
familiar
to
you
i'm
sure
it
does
i
know
everyone
who
is
reading
this
has
experienced
this
or
is
struggling
with
it
currently
we
are
all
human
and
this
state
of
mind
is
a
very
uniquely
human
thing
we
feel
alone
i
for
example
feel
lonely
as
fuck
right
now
i
know
there
are
people
who
love
me
but
i
still
feel
lonely
i
see
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
but
i
can't
get
my
heart
to
feel
it
too
if
anyone
tells
me
that
i'm
important
i
matter
its
not
really
news
to
me
but
my
mind
doesn't
work
that
way
it
likes
to
dive
deep
into
labyrinths
of
doom
with
each
dead
end
the
terrible
thoughts
reflect
and
grow
bigger
fill
the
air
and
drown
any
breathing
creature
that
i've
been
raising
fondly
in
my
head
there
is
no
real
solution
to
states
like
this
i
could
tell
you
to
go
be
with
your
friends
but
sometimes
you
don't
have
friends
or
you
do
but
they
don't
give
you
that
space
of
comfort
i
could
tell
you
to
smoke
weed
or
get
drunk
or
do
drugs
a
temporary
solution
i
myself
sometimes
resort
to
but
it
just
makes
you
weaker
when
you
are
sober
i
can't
give
you
solutions
if
i
could
give
you
solutions
i
would
solve
my
own
issues
in
the
first
place
so
writing
this
doesn't
make
sense
because
it
is
not
going
to
help
you
in
any
way
i'm
only
writing
this
to
show
you
that
i
a
completely
random
person
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
someone
you
wouldn't
look
at
twice
i
am
the
same
person
as
you
i
relate
to
you
even
if
i
don't
want
to
we
are
going
through
the
same
shit
and
we'll
be
fine
in
the
end
because
if
there
was
ever
a
solution
and
we
could
lead
perfect
lives
that
would
be
a
problem
on
its
own
or
maybe
not
maybe
it
would
just
be
perfect
and
we
would
live
and
die
in
perfection
but
who
knows
that
condition
will
never
exist
in
the
messed
up
swamp
of
shit
we
are
all
sunk
in
we'll
live
on
and
we'll
cry
and
we'll
laugh
and
we'll
keep
being
basically
all
the
same
creatures
and
that's
why
i
stalking
is
a
disease
and
cc
is
an
environment
that
it
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
former
stalkers
like
myself
to
recover
is
anyone
else
interested
in
starting
a
stalker
support
group
some
kind
of
platform
through
which
we
can
fight

against

of

totally

i
dropped
out
of
tamu
after
3
years
partially
due
to
emotional
instability
and
my
need
to
be
closer
to
family
now
i'm
going
to
night
school
and
pursuing
a
profitable
career
my
only
regret
from
leaving
tamu
aside
from
crippling
debt
is
that
now
i
don't
know
if
i
can
ever
find
a
girl
who
is
attracted
to
me
and
shares
the
same
interests
as
me
i'm
gonna
be
lucky
to
find
a
girl
who
doesn't
have
kids
already
does
anybody
have
experience
meeting
people
outside
the
college
environment
80
of
the
time
these
days
i'm
so
embarrassed
about
my
existence
that
i
just
want
to
throw
up
or
float
away
or
hide
forever
how
do
i
stop
feeling
like
this

i
heard
some
terrible
things
about
the
wellness
exchange
hotline
i
heard
that
they
laugh
at
your
problems
or
that
they
are
just
downright
not
helpful
so
for
months
i
didnt
call
them
even
though
i
had
so
many
nights
when
i
couldnt
take
it
anymore
but
today
i
hit
a
new
low
in
my
depression
and
i
had
no
one
there
for
me
and
no
other
option
so
i
finally
called
the
hotline
number
a
woman
picked
up
and
i
asked
is
this
where
i
can
talk
to
someone
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
words
yes
im
a
therapist
i
burst
into
tears
she
was
so
sweet
and
she
talked
me
through
my
problems
even
though
i
was
crying
while
explaining
all
of
them
she
helped
me
more
than
i
could
have
even
expected
her
to
im
writing
this
because
i
want
other
people
to
realize
just
how
helpful
the
wellness
exchange
really
is
if
youre
having
a
hard
time
call
them
theyre
there
to
help
you
dont
make
excuses
like
i
did
this
is
such
a
wonderful
service
and
im
so
beyond
grateful
to
have
it
you
should
too
if
youre
dealing
with
something
make
that
phone
call
youre
all
special
and
appreciated
and
you
all
deserve
to
get
the
help
you
need
no
matter
how
small
you
may
think
your
problems
are
dont
be
afraid
to
reach
out
theyre
there
to
help
you
who
attempted
suicide
i
can't
sleep
at
nights
so
i
pace
around
the
corridors
i
get
chest
pains
i
run
out
of
breath
i
want
to
cry
but
i
can't
because
everyone
here
is
supposed
to
be
happy
i
don't
qualify
for
a
diagnosis
of
depression
and
anxiety
is
something
everyone
suffers
from
i
understand
why
psychologists
wouldn't
want
to
do
something
about
it
but
i
don't
understand
why
every
time
i
tell
my
friends
they
say
a
fake
oh
i'm
sorry
when
their
facial
expressions
say
anything
but
sorry
more
like
haha
you
deserve
it
i
win
yes
that's
life
but
i
also
thought
that
you
get
what
you
give
where
are
the
genuinely
honest
people
15349
how
do
people
know
they
have
add
or
adhd
if
they
were
never
diagnosed
by
a
medical
doctor
say
you're
aware
of
most
of
the
symptoms
i
think
my
roommate
has
self
injury
issues
not
100
sure
but
and
i
don't
know
how
i'm
supposed
to
deal
with
that
would
it
make
my
roommate
feel
guilty
or
something
if
i
ask
about
it
explicitly
any
advice
appreciated

slowly
losing
my
mind
i
haven't
been
to
a
couple
of
my
classes
in
weeks
even
though
i
know
i
should
go
because
i
need
to
do
well
on
the
exams
every
day
i
feel
like
i
am
diverging
farther
and
farther
from
who
i
thought
i
was
i
liked
that
girl
but
why
do
i
have
to
change
and
no
matter
how
hard
i
try
i
feel
like
i
can't
change
back

disordered
eating
i
know
it's
fucked
but
i
have
hard
time
seeing
myself
as
acceptable
attractive
unless
i
am
at
least
at
least
20
lbs
under
my
medically
reccomended
bmi
but
here
i
am
drunkenly
eating
malt
easter
egg
candies
thus
i
will
feel
like
shit
in
the
morning
yolo
ihatemylself
i
wish
i
could
connect
to
other
skin
pickers
out
there
maybe
the
pcs
could
put
something
together
for
those
with
dermatillomania
and
trichotillomania
but
prefably
after
winter
break
because
clearly
all
of
us
are
too
stressed
out
with
finals
and
gouging
holes
in
our
faces
right
now
thank
you

ps3
really
really
made
me
sad
that
and
all
of
the
prelims
i
have
this
week
just
make
me
so
so
sad
i
was
waiting
for
class
yesterday
and
i
was
on
the
3rd
floor
duffield
bridge
i
looked
down
and
this
familiar
feeling
came
back
again
it
would
be
so
easy
to
just
let
it
all
go
to
accidentally
trip
over
the
railing
i
thought
i
had
gotten
over
my
suicidal
thoughts
when
i
came
to
cornell
and
got
away
from
my
abusive
family
obviously
not
what
am
i
doing
with
my
life
i
don't
know
how
i
feel
about
trigger
warnings
not
just
on
confessions
but
everything
i
understand
that
minimizing
harm
to
somebody
else's
mental
health
is
ideal
but
once
you
leave
cc
and
the
comfort
of
the
community
that
is
super
cautious
about
hurting
other
people's
feelings
the
real
world
knocks
the
wind
out
of
you
i
do
not
mean
to
sound
cynical
and
scary
and
dark
but
the
reality
is
that
the
world
outside
of
cc
can
be
mean
and
insensitive
and
triggering
in
every
way
you
can
imagine
maybe
its
not
intentional
but
you
will
hear
and
experience
things
that
will
bring
up
terrible
memories
insecurities
or
tendencies
i
understand
that
cc
tries
to
foster
a
healthy
environment
but
when
i
left
i
found
that
by
pushing
aside
my
problems
my
fears
my
disorders
for
4
years
i
was
only
hurting
myself
i'm
just
now
facing
them
head
on
for
the
first
time
and
its
so
difficult
to
do
when
you're
trying
to
financially
support
yourself
and
create
a
life
i'm
not
saying
we
should
all
be
cruel
to
one
another
and
post
terrible
things
just
so
students
will
develop
a
thicker
skin
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
cc
students
have
the
hard
conversations
about
the
hard
things
in
their
lives
while
they're
at
cc
utilize
that
supportive
community
not
as
a
blanket
to
hide
under
but
as
a
pillar
of
strength
to
face
your
issues
people
say
you
should
wait
until
you're
ready
but
what
if
you're
never
ready
when
else
are
you
going
to
live
in
as
wonderful
a
community
environment
as
cc
don't
wait
until
your
issues
come
to
you
because
when
they
do
you
won't
know
how
to
handle
the
triggers
and
it'll
be
so
much
harder
to
deal
with
alone
what
if
i
am
not
okay
i
don't
know
i
have
been
trying
to
ignore
my
depression
since
last
spring
i
may
not
have
lost
my
virginity
completely
but
i
have
hooked
more
times
and
with
more
people
than
i
ever
expected
to
all
the
hookups
were
planned
i
wanted
to
do
them
and
i
have
fun
of
course
as
with
any
hookup
the
fun
the
happiness
was
only
momentary
i
have
messed
with
so
many
guy's
heads
and
so
many
guys
have
messed
with
my
head
why
can't
anybody
say
what
they
mean
i
am
starting
to
lower
my
self
worth
i
honestly
find
nothing
wrong
with
people
hooking
up
but
i
did
it
for
the
wrong
reasons
i
did
it
because
i
was
depressed
and
alone
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
who
care
so
much
but
none
of
them
know
i
am
starting
to
feel
like
i
can't
be
in
a
real
relationship
because
i
am
so
insecure
that
act
weird
and
like
an
asshole
to
any
guy
i
actually
like
because
i
guess
i
know
how
much
it
could
hurt
with
someone
i
like
i
am
sorry
for
the
long
confession
i
just
needed
to
let
this
out
when
i
was
little
my
mom
had
schizophrenia
and
she
was
unable
to
take
care
of
me
during
my
entire
childhood
i
felt
so
bad
for
her
because
she
had
a
really
hard
time
with
everything
and
she
didn't
even
know
she
had
it
until
she
was
diagnosed
later
on
in
her
life
her
psychiatrist
was
shitty
must
explain
why
texas
is
50th
in
the
us
when
it
comes
to
mental
health
care
anyways
i
had
vowed
to
major
in
psychology
and
go
to
med
school
and
become
a
psychiatrist
and
give
my
all
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
have
a
career
unfortunately
i
majored
in
chemistry
instead
and
am
a
graduate
student
but
i
cannot
stop
thinking
about
how
i
should've
majored
in
psychology
honestly
i'm
really
unhappy
with
my
choice
is
it
too
late
to
go
back
and
major
in
what
i
want
or
should
i
suck
it
up
and
stick
to
what
i've
already
achieved
i
think
i
have
an
eating
disorder
i
just
want
to
eat
all
the
time
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i'm
hungry
this
has
been
a
big
problem
for
me
since
i
left
home
last
year
for
example
i'll
sit
in
my
room
eating
peanut
butter
until
i
realize
i've
downed
like
half
the
jar
which
is
a
whole
day's
worth
of
fat
and
then
i
feel
physically
awful
for
like
6
hours
and
to
all
who
think
that
this
is
just
stupid
and
i
should
stop
eating
so
much
that's
the
problem
i
know
that
i
can
do
better
but
what
makes
me
think
i
need
help
is
that
i
don't
do
better
some
days
i
eat
like
a
normal
person
but
i
would
say
like
every
other
day
i
have
a
meal
where
i
eat
wayyy
too
much
i
eat
until
i'm
full
then
i
eat
until
it
hurts
and
then
i
sometimes
eat
more
the
guilt
that
comes
with
it
is
a
huge
part
of
the
problem
i
know
the
biggest
issue
here
is
self
control
and
that
sometimes
i
exercise
it
well
so
i
get
really
down
on
myself
after
i've
eaten
horribly
because
i
know
it
was
in
my
power
to
do
differently
it
feels
good
to
admit
that
in
a
public
space
but
i
know
that
i
need
more
i
need
help
who
do
i
talk
to
about
this
what
resources
are
out
there
for
me
if
you've
attempted
suicide
you
are
not
alone

my
confession
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
went
through
a
major
bout
of
depression
i
felt
alone
scared
and
i
could
feel
myself
drowning
but
every
time
i
tried
to
scream
for
help
i
felt
like
someone
had
put
my
voice
on
mute
and
no
sounds
could
escape
my
throat
around
friends
i
was
always
smiling
and
laughing
because
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
what
they
want
from
me
i'm
the
happy
go
lucky
one
in
the
group
if
i
can't
provide
my
usual
cheery
attitude
than
what
do
i
really
have
to
offer
eventually
my
self
loathing
became
so
severe
that
i
thought
maybe
it
would
be
just
better
if
i
killed
myself
i
was
so
sure
that
i
had
become
nothing
more
than
a
burden
to
those
around
me
that
i
thought
why
do
i
even
exist
i'm
nothing
more
than
dead
weight
my
very
presence
is
a
punishment
to
those
around
me
if
i
truly
cared
for
them
than
i
should
do
them
the
favor
of
ending
myself
so
as
to
stop
being
such
a
nuisance
in
their
lives
my
self
hatred
had
become
so
powerful
that
i
thought
the
most
productive
thing
i
could
do
in
this
world
was
to
terminate
my
existence
but
i
could
never
have
been
more
wrong
than
i
was
then
i
have
so
much
to
offer
in
this
world
i
am
la
oving
brother
an
amazing
son
a
wonderful
partner
in
life
a
splendid
friend
who
puts
others
before
himself
and
a
fucking
phenomenal
individual
who
is
nowhere
near
done
showing
the
world
what
the
hell
he
can
accomplish
and
while
coming
to
that
realization
was
a
difficult
process
it
was
possible
thanks
to
the
support
and
care
of
loving
family
and
friends
a
wonderful
therapist
who
listened
to
me
and
never
tried
to
belittle
my
experience
shout
out
to
butler
hospital
and
medication
that
while
stigmatized
is
so
helpful
because
depression
is
a
biological
process
and
often
times
is
best
treated
with
a
combination
of
therapy
and
medication
so
i
want
to
leave
this
message
for
those
who
are
currently
struggling
with
depression
you
are
all
so
amazing
so
talented
so
beautiful
inside
and
out
and
the
world
has
only
just
begin
to
see
how
brilliant
you
are
so
please
don't
question
your
place
in
this
world
you
are
wonderful
and
you
are
loved
i
love
you
i
don't
know
you
but
i
love
you
because
you
are
a
unique
individual
with
a
special
story
to
tell
and
i
want
to
hear
that
story
so
if
you
ever
feel
like
you're
questioning
your
existence
please
seek
help
whether
its
from
a
friend
colleague
or
medical
professional
because
no
one
deserves
to
endure
the
struggle
of
depression
especially
not
alone
i
promise
you
that
it
does
get
better
i
am
a
survivor
and
i
know
you
are
too
so
fight
and
never
back
down
and
show
depression
that
you
are
powerful
and
fierce
and
you
cannot
be
defeated

anyone
ever
get
caught
in
an
endless
loop
of
depression
you
feel
bad
about
something
but
then
feel
even
worse
for
feeling
bad
because
there
are
so
many
people
in
the
world
worse
off
than
you
8382
is
there
anyone
here
who
was
depressed
but
somehow
got
out
of
it
i
just
want
things
to
go
back
to
normal
and
there's
no
reason
for
me
to
be
depressed
i'm
just
tired
all
the
damn
time
even
though
i
sleep
so
long
every
night
and
i
want
enough
energy
to
get
through
the
day
i
used
to
cut
in
high
school
i
have
scars
on
my
arms
and
can't
hide
them
because
corps
uniform
makes
it
impossible
to
always
have
my
forearms
covered
there's
a
girl
in
my
outfit
who
went
to
high
school
with
me
and
knows
that
i
was
extremely
depressed
and
suicidal
and
hate
my
scars
now
that
i'm
better
yet
all
the
time
she
jokes
about
my
cuts
and
brings
attention
to
them
i
really
want
her
to
stop
but
she's
really
sensitive
and
will
most
likely
try
to
turn
the
outfit
on
me
if
i
say
it
wrong
what
should
i
do
i
have
moments
every
day
where
i
feel
extremely
overjoyed
and
hopeful
and
nothing
can
turn
it
off
i
also
have
moments
every
day
where
i
feel
hopelessly
suicidal
and
nothing
will
make
me
feel
ok
except
waiting
it
out
then
i
have
moments
where
i
feel
like
a
normal
stable
person
whose
just
chilling
maybe
feeling
happy
and
sad
at
the
same
time
but
mostly
feeling
nothing
too
dramatic
what's
my
issue
am
i
just
overthinking
everything
am
i
bipolar
am
i
manic
or
am
i
simply
a
human
being
why
is
there
so
many
suicidal
posts
if
you
want
to
end
your
life
please
go
seek
help
i
keep
ignoring
your
posts
hang
in
there
it
might
feel
like
hell
but
try
to
smile
it
works
i
feel
depressed
i
constantly
lie
about
my
feelings
and
make
sure
my
attitude
is
always
positive
if
only
because
i
hate
pity
i
can't
tell
anyone
about
my
real
feelings
because
then
i
will
hate
myself
more
not
my
rpls
because
they're
not
the
depressed
type
not
my
roommate
because
we're
so
different
not
my
friends
because
i
don't
have
any
at
least
they
don't
care
for
me
as
much
as
i
used
to
care
for
them
and
they
act
super
fake
and
say
noooo
we
loooove
you
not
my
parents
because
i'm
not
ready
to
come
out
to
them
i'm
crushing
so
bad
on
someone
whom
i
can
never
have
i'm
not
as
smart
as
my
peers
nor
am
i
as
talented
at
anything
as
they
are
why
am
i
at
brown
i've
known
that
i've
suffered
from
a
mental
illness
for
all
of
these
years
but
i
never
was
too
sure
of
what
it
could
be
i
went
to
a
psychiatrist
this
week
and
he
told
me
that
it's
borderline
personality
disorder
i've
looked
into
it
and
it
explains
my
life
so
perfectly
almost
to
a
point
where
it's
scary
now
that
i've
been
diagnosed
when
would
be
the
appropriate
time
in
a
relationship
to
tell
someone
i
don't
want
to
scare
people
away
with
them
thinking
that
i'm
some
kind
of
psychopath
but
then
again
it
could
help
them
cope
with
my
different
personality
16417
i
ended
one
friendship
two
weekends
ago
he
may
not
know
or
care
i'm
about
to
do
the
same
with
you
this
past
year
has
been
hard
but
i
have
reaffirmed
my
worth
and
self
respect
i'm
better
and
stronger
than
you
know
in
before
but
are
you
harder
faster
cornell
and
the
world
are
so
much
bigger
and
significant
than
the
people
who
can't
be
bothered
to
care
to
all
the
people
who
periodically
post
about
depression
loneliness
and
f
cked
up
friends
don't
forget
how
awesome
you
are
you
really
are
and
when
you
stop
catastrophizing
and
chastising
yourself
long
enough
you'll
see
that
again
what
would
be
y'alls
thoughts
on
dating
someone
with
a
mental
health
condition
such
as
bipolar
clinical
depression
or
something
similar
and
yes
a
ton
of
people
probably
know
who
is
asking
just
don't
fucking
say
it
please
there
are
times
when
i'd
be
sitting
in
class
and
all
of
a
sudden
my
eyes
would
go
tunnel
vision
and
it'd
feel
like
the
walls
are
collapsing
in
on
me
and
that
there's
not
enough
air
in
the
room
and
all
my
pores
are
opening
up
and
sweating
everywhere
i'd
have
to
bolt
out
of
the
room
and
find
a
quiet
corner
outside
and
hug
myself
for
maybe
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
to
make
them
go
away
i
tried
telling
one
of
my
friends
about
this
i
thought
she'd
understand
she
had
been
through
hell
and
we
had
been
close
for
years
instead
she
called
me
a
straight
white
male
who
lives
in
the
suburbs
and
has
never
worked
a
day
in
his
life
what
right
do
i
have
to
be
feeling
these
feelings
when
there
are
so
many
worse
things
happening
in
the
world
does
my
privilege
mean
that
i
suddenly
can't
have
anxiety
that
somehow
i'm
not
allowed
to
address
my
screwed
up
hormones
as
things
that
are
real
and
that
terrorize
me
every
day
i
know
somebody
here
is
gonna
tell
me
to
go
to
counseling
or
peer
counselors
but
what
the
fuck
is
the
point
if
my
closest
friends
think
i'm
somehow
faking
or
exaggerating
my
symptoms
because
i
have
no
reason
to
be
feeling
them
in
the
first
place
7741
no
one
believes
me
when
i
tell
them
i'm
actually
really
shy
with
social
anxiety
how
hard
is
it
to
believe
that
a
girl
who
seems
to
have
everything
going
for
her
looks
brains
friends
could
actually
be
dying
inside
under
the
stress
and
the
pressure
to
try
and
keep
up
the
act
i
think
college
is
turning
me
into
an
alcoholic
because
drinking
is
now
the
only
way
i
can
go
to
my
mixers
and
feel
somewhat
comfortable
and
all
the
stress
is
just
making
my
eating
disorder
come
back
the
worst
part
is
i'm
so
good
at
lying
and
pretending
that
i
can't
even
go
talk
to
someone
about
it
because
i
know
all
the
right
answers
to
make
them
think
nothing
is
wrong
with
me
summer
can't
come
soon
enough
when
i
was
abroad
the
university
i
attended
also
had
a
confessions
page
some
of
the
posts
were
hilarious
for
example
one
guy
blacked
out
and
his
flatmates
poured
yogurt
all
over
his
bed
to
make
it
look
like
he
blew
his
load
all
over
the
place
i
know
that's
disgusting
but
it
makes
me
laugh
i
believe
that
the
point
of
this
page
is
to
post
things
that
make
people
laugh
isn't
that
what
the
internet
is
all
about
i
truly
wish
that
instead
of
professing
their
anxieties
people
would
just
post
funny
and
gross
stories
about
their
time
at
kenyon
i
understand
that
people
believe
that
they
have
no
one
else
to
talk
to
and
that
there
is
a
sense
of
catharsis
in
expressing
yourself
here
but
i
guarantee
as
someone
who
also
struggles
with
an
anxiety
disorder
and
depression
expressing
yourself
through
this
outlet
only
provides
a
short
lived
form
of
satisfaction
