Instead of being the good samaritan and leaving it in a safe place for it's rightful owner, I stole the horn. I became obsessed with the horn, and the bellowing, obnoxious racket it produced. It's blaring roar become dulcet tones, like music to my ears, and the horn slowly divided me and my now-former friends, driving apart the strong bonds and friendships made over the two years prior, ruining mine, and others, supervisions, lectures and sleeping patterns. Eventually I become a recluse, alienated from my course mates and consigned to my room, with only the horn and it's wailing cacophony to keep me company. Fast forward, and the horn has been split into three pieces, never to be reunited in my lifetime - two taken away from me, in safe guardianship of stronger minds, and the other remaining in my possession, in silent slumber in my room - a constant reminder of my past mistakes. Sometimes I still hear the blaring honks in my head, and I am soothed, but I know I can never go back, and can only try to live my life like before.",26.0,4.0,Cambridge
