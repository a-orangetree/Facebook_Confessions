who's
going
to
mimosa
saturday
somewhere
baby
it's
part
of
me
apart
from
me
you're
laying
waste
to
halloween
you
fucked
it
friend
it's
on
it's
head
it
struck
the
street
you're
in
milwaukee
off
your
feet
i've
been
in
love
with
the
same
girl
since
the
sixth
grade
of
high
school
we
were
only
actually
together
for
6
months
of
senior
year
and
those
six
months
were
the
best
months
of
my
life
for
all
those
who
embrace
the
hook
up
culture
at
cc
you
are
lying
to
everyone
around
you
and
yourself
meaningless
sex
will
not
fulfill
you
a
two
week
relationship
will
not
fill
the
inadequacies
you
feel
within
you
your
stats
or
highest
score
will
not
make
you
feel
better
about
yourself
or
teach
you
about
your
sexuality
an
orgasm
in
not
love
an
orgasm
is
animal
instinct
i
represent
the
quiet
conglomerate
of
men
who
will
refuse
to
be
impressed
by
how
much
you
drink
you're
various
piercings
how
well
you
know
how
to
suck
a
dick
how
understanding
you
are
of
what
you
like
or
how
well
you
dance
i
would
rather
you
tell
me
about
yourself
your
favorite
musician
food
movie
etc
over
dinner
than
i
would
have
you
tell
me
while
we're
already
in
bed
after
i
had
asked
for
your
drunken
consent
following
the
2
4
beer
pong
games
i
had
won
and
shouted
about
well
within
your
earshot
and
then
have
you
gone
by
the
time
i
wake
up
i
love
nothing
more
than
hearing
the
way
you
sound
when
you
let
me
stick
my
hand
between
your
legs
but
i
am
more
enamored
by
how
we
both
feel
watching
a
movie
or
seeing
a
concert
together
than
i
am
by
anything
that
happens
sexually
between
us
nothing
not
sex
drugs
nor
rock
and
roll
can
possibly
feel
better
than
loving
someone
and
having
them
love
you
back
and
if
you
feel
nothing
in
moving
on
to
the
next
hook
up
you
probably
should
not
have
hooked
up
to
begin
with
i
am
a
freshman
and
my
older
brother
went
to
cc
and
graduated
here
in
2008
he
didn't
have
a
single
meaningful
relationship
here
his
entire
college
career
all
he
can
look
back
on
is
meaningless
sex
and
disappointment
yes
some
might
call
us
a
progressive
school
despite
the
fact
that
the
event
we've
had
thus
far
with
the
largest
amount
of
school
funding
included
both
a
loosely
ordained
theme
of
ice
yes
it
is
cold
in
wintertime
colorado
and
a
schedule
of
which
loosely
clad
girls
would
be
dancing
on
stage
at
specific
times
but
are
relationships
really
helped
by
our
type
of
progression
is
the
hook
up
culture
really
something
we
should
feel
pride
in
i
think
not
at
heart
i
am
a
romantic
and
fuck
this
school
for
making
me
feel
like
i
am
the
outcast
because
of
that
if
i
am
still
in
love
with
the
same
girl
that
i
first
fell
in
love
with
since
the
sixth
grade
then
i
am
more
than
confident
that
anyone
reading
this
can
relate
in
some
small
way
so
fuck
everyone
who
is
tries
to
act
any
different
just
to
fit
in
with
this
supposed
culture
it
is
not
organic
it
is
forced
love
is
organic
love
can
never
be
forced
confession
i
have
a
fantasy
to
have
sex
in
every
possible
place
here
on
campus
but
sadly
i
dont
know
of
any
good
places
to
do
that
other
than
evans
and
annex
can
yall
help
me
out
here
where
do
you
find
the
list
of
adjunct
courses

gpgblm6t9xy
i
dont
know
whats
worse
the
sick
people
who
think
up
these
posts
or
the
sick
people
who
encourage
it
by
liking
and
commenting
cant
we
all
just
be
normal
why
were
there
a
large
group
of
people
wearing
red
shirts
and
glows
sticks
jogging
around
tamu
at
9pm
on

i
too
feel
like
i
have
met
the
person
i
think
i
could
marry
in
college
we
get
along
really
well
but
we
both
have
pseudo
romantic
interests
i
think
also
insecurity
coming
out
that
he
is
much
too
attractive
for
me
but
whatever
we
can
talk
for
hours
without
getting
bored
and
he's
shared
secrets
with
me
and
i've
shared
secrets
with
him
maybe
if
things
don't
work
out
between
him
and
the
girl
he's
seeing
i'll
make
a
move
but
until
then
maybe
i'll
just
enjoy
this
friendship
it's
awesome
connecting
with
someone
like
we
do
a
girl
can
still
hope
right
i
feel
like
i
am
full
of
contradictions
i
don't
know
who
i
am
yet
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
deal
with
all
of
my
emotions
and
predicaments
when
i
don't
know
who
i
am
or
what
i
want
or
where
i
am
going
all
of
my
problems
boil
down
to
trying
to
figure
out
if
i
love
myself
or
if
i
hate
myself
do
i
feel
worthy
and
deserving
of
everything
in
my
life
am
i
capable
of
being
loved
should
i
keep
fighting
to
live
or
should
i
just
quit
most
days
i
don't
accomplish
anything
productive
because
i
am
too
deep
in
my
head
trying
to
answer
these
questions
i've
spent
hours
fantasizing
about
being
shot
or
murdered
somehow
i've
romanticized
that
thought
in
my
head
so
much
so
that
it
brings
me
pleasure
to
think
of
the
people
in
my
life
missing
me
saying
kind
things
about
me
at
a
large
funeral
i
feel
like
i'll
only
matter
in
death
i
had
sex
with
two
different
guys
in
the
past
two
nights
senior
scramble
ftw
any
ags
goin
to
ljt
this
year
what
does
it
mean
if
i
guy
you're
talking
to
starts
bringing
up
past
relationships

nyu
bursar
abruptly
dropped
me
from
spring
14
classes
because
of
my
sponsor's
delay
to
remit
my
past
due
balance
this
happened
due
to
circumstances
in
my
family
beyond
my
control
despite
the
entreaty
for
time
to
pay
up
the
funds
including
written
commitment
to
pay
from
my
sponsor
i
was
denied
fair
consideration
i
was
in
my
third
semester
as
an
international
student
with
just
thesis
left
before
graduation
i
was
told
by
nyu
student
counselors
that
nyu
is
a
business
and
the
students
are
customers
seriously
of
course
it
is
understood
that
there
are
running
costs
my
program
administrator
also
said
we
do
not
have
a
pool
of
money
here
waiting
for
international
students
to
take
advantage
of
i
wanted
to
be
silent
about
this
because
i
am
considered
a
minority
but
i
feel
like
not
being
heard
is
no
reason
to
remain
in
silence
because
there
might
be
someone
in
my
shoes
out
there
there
could
be
a
great
lesson
here
as
to
the
question
is
nyu
primarily
an
academic
institution
established
to
impart
knowledge
or
to
amass
wealth
without
due
consideration
i'm
so
happy
i'm
not
pregnant
stopped
using
condoms
and
i'm
not
on
any
birth
control
and
i
still
got
my
period
never
knew
pulling
out
could
be
effective
thoughts
i'm
hesitant
to
want
to
start
birth
control
because
i
don't
want
it
to
change
anything
about
my
body
i.e
weight
gain
or
loss
hormones
skin
changes
change
in
boob
size
11434
serious
question
do
you
ladies
ever
sneak
a
look
in
the
locker
room
showers
at
the
gym
i
feel
like
you
have
to
take
an
occasional
peek
occasionally
i
smoke
when
i
drink
turn
off
don't
care
drinking
most
nights
1633
call
me
paranoid
but
whenever
i
read
an
nyu
secret
that
somehow
relates
to
my
life
i
instantly
think
the
secret
is
about
me
i
know
it's
unlikely
since
this
page
has
over
"10,000"
likes
but
it's
not
impossible
right
i
hate
it
when
guys
ask
me
at
parties
if
i
go
to
woo
state
or
assumption
no
i
go
to
wpi
is
it
wrong
to
be
an
attractive
girl
and
go
to
an
engineering
school

soo
shanon
adams
the
senior
football
player
is
sooooo
cute
i've
seen
him
at
a
lot
of
black
events
and
i
just
think
he's
so
attractive
you're
a
senior
whyyyy
ahh
well
hopefully
next
semester
i'll
be
able
to
at
least
say
hi
to
you
oh
by
the
way
you
have
really
nice
arms
mmm
yaaas
sincerely
an
old
soul
i
wanted
to
visit
the
lgbt
resource
center
to
see
if
i
could
meet
a
guy
there
but
i
feel
like
it
is
an
inappropriate
use
of
the
resource
am
i
wrong
what
advice
would
you
give
why
do
most
girls
in
the
corps
hate
girls
in
soroties
i
finally
told
my
best
friend
how
i
really
feel
about
him
i
told
him
that
he
pisses
me
off
and
that
he
treats
me
like
complete
shit
every
time
i
make
an
effort
to
hang
out
with
him
he
says
he's
too
busy
to
hang
out
which
i
was
totally
fine
with
until
i
see
facebook
posts
that
he
and
some
buddies
are
boozing
it
up
on
northgate
really
but
whenever
i
say
i
can't
hangout
because
i
have
to
work
late
or
have
to
study
for
a
test
i
get
called
a
shitty
friend
for
not
wanting
to
hang
out
wtf
i've
always
been
there
for
him
and
even
offered
to
help
him
pay
for
school
expenses
when
he
was
cut
off
from
his
family
but
yet
he
doesn't
acknoweledge
that
i
exist
unless
he
needs
something
fuck
that
a
true
friendship
is
a
2
way
street
and
i
refuse
to
let
this
joke
of
a
friendship
ruin
my
senior
year
ain't
nobody
got
time
for
this
shit
i'm
done
11225
i
met
my
new
best
friend
during
my
last
semester

cornell

this
happen
sooner

i'm
the
cunt
suitemate
from
secret
5441
calling
me
that
was
pretty
childish
but
i
get
that
you're
mad
you
were
out
of
your
mind
drunk
and
probably
don't
remember
what
actually
happened
so
you
may
think
that
you
did
nothing
wrong
let
me
remind
you
you
were
moaning
crying
and
yelling
in
my
common
room
for
awhile
until
you
brought
that
and
your
bottomless
stomach
of
vomit
to
my
bathroom
for
hours
more
despite
repeated
bargaining
with
you
can
we
take
you
to
the
hospital
can
we
take
you
to
your
own
room
you
wouldn't
leave
after
some
debating
i
called
the
r.a
once
she
came
to
the
room
you
admitted
not
only
to
being
very
drunk
but
to
also
having
smoked
weed
which
generally
suppresses
vomiting
so
you
were
probably
way
sicker
than
i
imagined
i
didn't
know
that
the
rest
of
this
was
going
to
happen
to
you
and
i
didn't
call
the
r.a
to
spite
you
you
didn't
even
know
it
was
me
until
you
called
my
roommate
to
ask
who
it
was
earlier
today
i
might
have
said
that
i
was
sorry
but
you
turned
this
into
a
name
calling
pity
party
so
now
i
don't
care
please
don't
come
back
to
my
room
574
i
feel
so
incredibly
lonely
here
i
try
to
make
friends
and
be
socially
active
and
i
still
feel
like
everyone
hates
me
or
thinks
i'm
annoying
and
they
come
up
with
lame
excuses
not
to
hang
out
with
me
all
the
time
and
gossip
behind
my
back
not
to
mention
the
dating
life
is
so
screwed
up
here
with
people
either
already
in
relationships
back
home
or
scared
that
anyone
who
shows
interest
is
only
looking
for
marriage
or
too
scared
to
show
they
care
at
all
for
fear
of
rejection
or
something
what
about
some
good
genuine
company
i
thought
college
was
about
making
lifelong
friends
and
creating
lasting
memories
as
well
as
getting
an
education
looks
like
my
college
highlights
will
be
naps
in
my
dorm
room
foreveralone
is
there
a
rastafari
group

at
a

i'm
in
a
friends
with
benefits
relationship
with
someone
who
is
already
in
a
relationship
the
conditions
of
our
relationship
are
1
to
set
aside
emotions
and
2
that
her
boyfriend
should
never
know
about
our
relationship
she's
kept
her
promise
so
far
but
she
always
tells
me
that
things
are
falling
apart
between
her
and
her
boyfriend
due
to
other
elements
and
i
can't
help
but
wonder
if
she
is
developing
feelings
for
me
yet
when
things
between
her
and
her
boyfriend
go
too
far
i
can't
help
but
wonder
if
i
should
interfere
should
i
does
that
mean
i
have
emotions
for
her
4955

got
friend

music
i
just
like
feeling
a
guys
hard
dick
against
me
i
know
you're
busy
and
i'm
not
asking
for
all
of
your
time
but
you
can't
take
five
seconds
and
shoot
me
a
text
every
once
in
a
while
ain't
nobody
got
time
for
that
5395
can
we
both
forget
you

a
girlfriend
just

tonight
i
need
you
you

me
i
hate
myself
for
feeling
this
way
3561
am
i
the
only
guy
who
enjoys
giving
rim
jobs
7750
i'm
21
and
a
virgin
is
it
a
turnoff
for
guys
when
they
find
out
a
girl
is
that
old
and
is
still
a
virgin
there
is
someone
i
know
and
like
a
lot
our
friendship
means
the
world
to
me
but
i'm
not
so
sure
if
it
does
to
her
or
if
i'm
imagining
that
it
doesn't
or
i
turned
her
away
earlier
and
didn't
realize
we're
good
friends
and
i
want
to
explore
a
relationship
with
her
but
i
don't
know
how
to
go
from
friends
to
that
stage
any
help
the
guy
i
like
probably
will
never
know
don't
have
the
courage
to
go
and
speak
to
him
forever
alone
shouldn't
be
that
bad
right
5268
i
am
in
love
with
someone
that
i
shouldn't
be
socially
morally
physically
we
shouldn't
be
together
but
there's
something
that
continues
to
draw
me
to
him
i
know
it's
wrong
and
that
something
must
change
but
nothing
happens
i'm
still
there
everyday
to
be
with
him
sometimes
moving
on
with
your
life
starts
with
goodbye
spending
money
on
sul
ross
doesnt
help
much
i
could
be
spending
that
money
on
strippers
or
something
if
i
give
you
a
nickel
would
you
tickle
my
pickle
if
i'm
happy
with
my
body
does
that
make
me
vain
i
don't
think
i'm
perfect
nor
do
i
flaunt
the
fact
that
i
genuinely
like
the
way
i
look
but
i
do
spend
a
few
minutes
everyday
admiring
my
own
butt
in
the
mirror
i'm
a
self
proclaimed
atheist
yet
when
it
comes
to
my
loved
ones
being
safe
i
pray
to
a
higher
being
to
a
non
particular
god
if
you
will
what
does
that
make
me
11422
you're

he
has
big
blue
eyes
and
my
knees
weaken
whenever
i
see

we're
both
shy
introverts
so

only
been
shy
smiles
and
eye
contact

the
guys
at
georgetown
short
i
just
want
a
tree
to
climb
i
know
most
comments
are
going
to
be
hateful
but
it
really
is
a
confession
i
am
female
btw
i
just
want
a
man
with
an
good
education
that
leads
to
excellent
job
potential
i
want
a
christian
who
both
my
parents
will
love
i
want
respect
loyalty
and
honesty
i
want
adventure
and
excitement
as
well
as
structure
and
discipline
i
want
to
meet
someone
who
likes
hunting
and
the
outdoors
just
as
much
as
i
do
yes
guys
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
self
confidence
issues
and
just
can't
date
anyone
my
height
or
shorter
so
i
would
prefer
someone
tall
does
this
even
still
exist
today
634
i'm
younger
than
the
guy
i'm
dating
he's
going
to
graduate
in
may
and
move
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
if
i
end
it
now
will
i
avoid
being
hurt
later
alright
ags
i
need
some
advice
so
i've
been
talking
to
this
really
cute
girl
lately
whose
really
fun
and
has
a
great
personality
and
we've
been
getting
along
great
i
even
found
out
that
her
hometown
is
about
an
hour
drive
from
mine
so
we
could
visit
each
other
over
winter
break
there's
only
one
problem
she's
chubby
now
she's
not
gross
chubby
but
she
does
have
a
little
bit
of
a
belly
and
her
arms
are
a
little
flabby
honestly
i
would
have
no
problem
dating
her
but
i'm
really
worried
about
what
my
friends
would
think
my
friends
have
high
expectations
for
the
girls
i
date
i
don't
mean
to
brag
but
i've
dated
girls
with
toned
bodies
or
really
nice
bodies
and
i
feel
that
by
dating
this
girl
they
would
think
less
of
me
i
know
some
of
y'all
are
going
to
say
that
my
friends
should
accept
me
and
stupid
crap
like
that
but
that's
the
thing
they
do
i'm
just
worried
that
their
expectations
of
the
girls
i
date
and
of
my
taste
in
women
would
drop
and
they
would
kind
of
on
a
subconscious
level
respect
me
less
they'd
still
remain
my
friends
and
whatnot
but
i
just
know
that
they'd
think
less
of
me
at
least
on
a
subconscious
level
i'm
really
torn
because
she
has
such
a
gorgeous
face
and
such
a
fantastic
personality
but
i
really
don't
want
my
friends
to
think
less
of
me
so
ags
what
should
i
do
tl
dr
op
is
contemplating
on
dating
a
chubby
girl
curtailed
i
know
for
a
fact
that
college
station
has
orgies
i
want
to
join
a
swingers
club
or
something
similar
can
anyone
point
me
on
the
right
direction
the
fuck
happend
to
kanye
man

face
without
sounding
like

bitch
15401

the
silly
funny
confessions

to
happen
so
were
can
i
meet
latina
women
at
here
in
palestine
how
do
girls
make
friends
besides
sororities
i
know
it
sounds
lame
but
i'm
in
a
flo
and
try
to
join
things
but
i
don't
find
myself
ever
getting
past
the
sort
of
friends
stage
with
anyone
new
and
i
hate
that
i
always
find
myself
hanging
out
with
old
high
school
friends
also
of
the
few
girl
friends
that
i
have
made
they
have
all
decided

what
i
want
for
myself
4881
you
say
you're
not
confusing
if
that's
not
ambiguity

must
be
an
asshole
where

gentlemen
nowhere
to
be
found
14278
some
days
without
reason
i'll
just
get
very
mellow
kinda
sad
and
contemplative
on
my
life
i'm
usually
a
very
happy
person
but
i
guess
even
happy
people
fall
into
a
sad
day
every
once
in
awhile
without
prompting
is
this
normal
has
anyone
else
experienced
this
16983
just
once
before
i
graduate
i'd
love
to
hook
up
with
a
girl
where
are
all
the
bi
curious
ones
how
long
after
you
graduate
can
you
keep
up
your
college
drinking
habits
until
you're
declared
an
alcoholic
i
just
don't
think
i
can
handle
the
real
world
6135
i've
been
anorexic
for
3
years
now
and
its
exhausting
the
cycles
of
weight
gain
and
loss
the
constant
monitoring
of
what
food
im
eating
i
want
to
be
completely
healthy
and
i
want
to
stop
hating
my
body
but
i
cant
my
mind
wont
let
me
ive
gotten
a
lot
better
but
the
anxiety
still
persists
and
i
dont
think
it
will
ever
go
away
i
dont
think
caps
can
help
me
and
in
truth
i
almost
dont
want
them
to
i
just
want
to
eat
whatever
i
want
and
stay
thin
someone
change
biology
for
me
please
731
it
sickens
me
how
people
glorify
getting
blackout
drunk
you're
proud
of
getting
so
hammered
that
you
literally
can't
remember
pieces
of
or
your
entire
night
you're
okay
with
using
it
as
an
excuse
to
whore
yourself
out
how
does
that
at
all
seem
healthy
god
dammit
have
some
self
respect
people
so
i
have
this
friend
i
drugged
him
to
induce
seizures
and
time
loss
but
i
did
it
for
the
right
reason
you
know
like
i
wasn't
gonna
go
to
prison
anyway
he
sends
this
person
to
investigate
me
and
they
find
the
organs
so
i
had
to
kill
them
it
was
a
delicious
and
unexpected
surprise
what
do
i
do
now
no
school
where's
the
brews
at
that
moment
when
you
park
and
there
are
black
guys
with
their
ghetto
cars
parked
right
next
to
you
but
they
are
inside
the
car
and
keeps
staring
at
you
in
1am
leaves
at
2am
and
comes
back
8am
just
to
park
on
the
other
side
of
your
car
and
doing
the
same
shit
i
am
worried
about
my
car
i
guess
i
am
kind
of
racist
but
i
cant
help
it
what
would
you
do
i
wish
i
had
the
time
to
park
my
car
to
the
other
side
of
parking
lot
so
they
can't
park
next
to
me
oh
and
they
are
def
not
my
neighbors
lol
632
i
hate
the
normal
awkward
georgetown
parties
if
you
need
to
keep
a
beer
pong
table
out
so
awkward
people
have
a
place
to
stand
and
do
nothing
then
you
suck
at
throwing
a
party
put
the
fucking
beer
pong
table
away
once
the
music
starts
popping
guys
need
to
do
more
than
just
grabbing
girls
hips
and
going
side
to
side
like
its
a
fucking
8th
grade
dance
girls
need
to
bounce
their
asses
more
and
shouldn't
need
to
get
drunk
to
get
comfortable
fuck
everyone
guys
and
girls
who
makes
a
disgusted
face
when
people
are
getting
their
groove
on
just
because
your
awkward
ass
does
nothing
but
stand
by
the
keg
all
night
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
ruin
the
fun
for
everyone
else
to
the
honies
flash
your
tits
why
does
no
one
do
this
because
we
love
to
fucking
label
people
as
hoe
or
skank
they're
just
boobs
people
we
all
love
them
wear
skanky
things
feel
sexy
enjoy
yourselves
to
the
boys
please
make
something
nice
to
drink
other
than
your
fucking
kegs
and
jungle
juices
there
are
classy
ladies
here
who
aren't
looking
for
10
beers
flash
yo
abs
if
you
want
work
out
dudes
don't
be
creepy
and
don't
force
anything
on
girls

don't
give
a
fuck
what
your
major
is
i
don't
give
a
fuck
what
school
your
in
i
don't
give
a
fuck
about
how
many
midterms
you
have
learn
to
have
a
real
conversation
please
when
guys
grab
girl's
asses
at
parties
it
makes
me
extremely
upset
why
do
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
do
that
to
someone
you
have
no
idea
how
it
effects
them
based
on
their
past
experiences
last
night
at
ksig
a
guy
grabbed
two
of
my
friends
asses
if
i
knew
who
he
was
i
would
have
punched
him
in
the
face
as
a
victim
of
sexual
assault
nothing
could
be
more
offensive
disgusting
and
cruel
go

distribute

like

or
enjoy
having
terrible

338
sometimes
i
feel
like
i'll
never
get
over
my
ex
boyfriend
or
what
he
did
to
me
i'm
still
hurting
everyday
and
i'm
scared
that
i'll
never
find
anyone
again
i'm
not
ready
to
let
anyone
else
in
yet
but
what
if
when
i
am
its
too
late
one
of
us
has
to
make
a
move
right
so
damn
frustrating
especially
because

god
damn
cute
terrible
that
i
just
want
a
valentine
7505
according
to
most
i
have
an
eating
disorder
but
i'm
not
exactly
asking
for
help
in
fact
i'm
denying
it
i
refused
to
see
doctors
anymore
and
i've
recently
gone
back
to
not
eating
or
taking
my
supplements
i
can
feel
my
body
shutting
down
i'm
losing
steam
and
fast
i
even
got
sick
tonight
and
what
was
the
remedy
you
may
ask
half
a
bag
of
pretzels
and
some
mountain
dew
i'm
going
in
circles
and
i
know
i
have
the
resources
to
help
me
but
i'm
petrified
i
feel
alone
here
like
i
have
no
one
really
to
talk
to
what
doesn't
kill
you
makes
you
stronger
i
guess
4192
i
have
way
more
than
3
b's
on
my
transcript
and
some
lower
grades
too
and
guess
what
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
my
self
worth
someone
tell
my
room
mate
to
stop
eating
my
stuff
me
and
this
bitch
don't
even
talk
but
her
disrespectful
self
think
it's
ok
to
steal
my
stuff
thief
where
the
cops
at
i'd
so
do
me
why
am
i
still
a
virgin
i'm
hot
as
fuck
812
i
must
say
that
i
need
to
confess
this
out
because
it
has
been
bothering
me
all
day
to
the
person
that
talks
a
lot
in
one
of
my
morning
classes
i
need
to
say
a
few
things
first
of
all
how
rude
of
you
to
point
someone
out
who
was
sleeping
during
class
it
is
none
of
your
business
to
embarrass
other
people
just
because
they
might
not
being
attention
in
class
if
the
professor
feels
that
it
is
something
that
is
disturbing
the
class
then
the
professor
will
do
something
not
the
student
you
know
why
it
is
none
of
your
business
because
people
are
paying
for
their
education
here
and
they
have
the
choice
to
either
pay
attention
in
the
class
and
get
superior
grades
or
not
pay
attention
and
do
something
else
either
way
they
will
end
up
paying
for
their
own
education
and
deserve
the
grade
that
they
get
based
on
their
performance
on
class
who
knows
that
person
might
be
an
athlete
who
woke
up
early
for
practice
that
is
why
he
was
tired
in
class
or
maybe
he
stayed
up
late
doing
homework
and
didn't
get
the
enough
sleep
but
still
manage
to
go
to
class
maybe
that
person
had
one
of
these
situation
and
that
is
why
he
needed
a
little
shut
eye
in
order
to
concentrate
who
knows
i
would
also
like
to
indicate
that
because
of
you
indicating
this
person
sleeping
in
class
you
not
only
disturb
the
class
but
also
you
made
the
class
feel
uneasy
uncomfortable
next
time
think
about
your
actions
and
how
it
can
affect
others
because
talking
second
point
i
want
to
state
is
that
you
can't
force
people
to
participate
in
class
if
they
don't
want
to
maybe
you
might
find
it
a
boring
class
but
others
might
like
listening
to
others
that
is
why
they
don't
talk
in
discussion
or
maybe
they
are
very
shy
people
i
can
keep
going
but
yeah
that
remark
i
feel
was
very
unnecessary
to
spit
out
in
class
and
was
like
a
slap
in
the
face
to
all
the
students
in
that
class
i
used
to
view
you
a
good
person
in
class
but
now
my
view
tends
to
be
negative
and
dislike
you
i
don't
know
if
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
class
that
feels
this
way
but
i
feel
like
a
coward
for
not
speaking
up
in
class
why
is
everyone
on
here
so
ignorant
on
greek
life
what
have
they
ever
done
to
you
yes
i
admit
we
do
party
but
not
all
of
us
we
do
not
get
shitfaced
every
weekend
i
don't
even
like
going
to
northgate
i
am
pretty
sure
nongreeks
party
too
we
have
our
own
philanthropy
which
we
try
our
hardest
to
fundraise
for
a
good
cause
we
strive
for
sisterhood
or
brotherhood
but
we
are
not
perfect
yes
not
all
of
us
get
along
do
all
of
your
family
members
get
along
don't
you
fight
with
your
siblings
sometimes
our
organzation
is
not
perfect
neither
is
yours
every
greek
org
is
different
i
am
annoy
by
them
sometimes
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
am
proud
to
call
them
my
sisters
and
best
friends
yea
we
can
address
each
other
as
friends
too
and
the
dues
it
goes
toward
the
events
we
host
and
even
for
when
we
go
out
to
eat
and
yes
we
do
have
friends
outside
our
sororities
fraternities
but
seriously
if
yall
think
if
greek
life
is
all
about
yolo
a
m
would
let
us
exist
we
do
have
a
gpa
requirement
fyi
seriously
it's
not
nice
to
look
down
upon
people

why
does
noyes
gym
have
such
crappy
hours
this
week
i
get
that
students
have
exams
but
all
the
other
gyms
seem
to
have
normal
hours
what
gives
kflo
when
are
the
matches
being
made
to
our
worner
boxes
or
have
they
already
11142
i
think
i
mistakenly
got
an
invitation
to
the
dean's
list
awards
banquet
since
there's
no
way
my
gpa
would
have
qualified
did
everyone
get
this
email
or
should
i
email
them
back
saying
they
sent
it
to
the
wrong
person
i
thought
break
would
be
the
time
to
get
over
whatever
it
is
that
i
have
for
you
but
here
we
are
and
i
still
feel
the
same
way
and
i
still
have
a
boyfriend
and
it
still
can't
happen
what
do
we
do
about
this
i'm
so
drawn
to
you
i
met
zita
a
few
months
ago
and
was
wondering
can
you
teach
me
to
dance
all
sexy
oh
and
would
it
bother
you
to
know
that
i'm
a
guy
and
wants
to
stun
women
with
my
dancing
skills
like
that
one
movie
girls
drooled
over
magic
mike
6212
why
don't
people
dance
the
busdriver
anymore
so
if
you
walk
under
the
century
tree
you
will
be
together
forever
what
happens
if
you
carve
your
initials
oh
i
know
you
get
your
ass
kicked
by
everyone
else
transfer
to
another
university
before
we
find
you
i
need
to
ask
you
something
and
i
want
you
to
be
totally
honest
with
me
it
might
be
awkward
with
us
after
this
but
i
have
to
know
how
you
feel
i
have
kept
this
in
for
a
while
and
its
about
time
i
was
straight
up
and
just
confront
you
about
it
i
hope
this
doesn't
ruin
the
relationship
we
already
have
i
just
need
to
know
and
i
can't
see
any
other
way
to
get
over
this
it
just
doesn't
seem
fair
on
me
if
i
don't
get
an
answer
i
want
you
to
tell
me
truthfully
no
matter
what
it
is
i
just
want
your
honest
opinion
do
you
know
the
muffin
man
17969
so
today
i
walked
past
this
guy
and
i
saw
his
miami
heat
hat
and
i
subconsciously
shook
my
head
and
frowned
because
fuck
the
heat
right
he
asked
if
i
had
a
problem
and
i
just
kept
walking
cause
i
didn't
know
what
to
say
to
that
guy
sorry
bout
that
i
don't
have
anything
against
you
just
your
team
i'm
in
love
with
brittany
that
often
goes
to
the
rec
she
looks
fantastic
there's
no
way
she's
single
but
a
guy
can
dream
right
it
bothers
me
when
people
don't
read
comments
and
add
their
own
from
the
main
link
are
they
wrong
not
my
call
but
on
this
page
in
particular
the
amount
of
don't
feed
the
troll
etc
that
go
almost
unacknowledged
is
a
bit
frustrating
i
mean
most
of
the
trolls
are
just
plain
bad
but
when
people
still
feed
them
despite
the
numerous
people
pointing
them
out
just
grinds
my
gears
a
little
endrant
why
can't
we
all
just
be
nice
i
wonder
if
the
hot
chick
with
the
six
person
rotation
for
sex
rests
on
sundays
or
maybe
sunday
is
group
day
when
all
six
partners
come
together
to
pleasure
her
each
bringing
their
own
special
talents
i'm
going
to
say
it's
the
latter
yes
definitely
the
latter
now
i'm
probably
going
to
get
naked
and
imagine
that
scenario
for
awhile
16066
i
had
sex
with
you
you
asked
me
to
have
sex
with
you
again
and
when
i
said
no
you
told
me
i
was
disgusting
anyway
how
could
you
do
that
to
me
the
puppy
store
pisses
me
the
fuck
off
go
to
the
shelters
and
give
those
puppies
attention
stop
promoting
breeders
and
especially
stores
that
sell
puppies
no
reputable
akc
breeder
although
it's
somewhat
easy
to
be
an
akc
breeder
and
not
be
reputable
due
to
lack
of
regulation
would
put
their
puppies
through
a
store
the
breeders
obviously
don't
care
about
the
well
being
of
the
dogs
they
send
off
to
those
stores
as
i
know
anyone
with
the
money
can
purchase
the
dog
no
screening
no
counseling
if
you
really
want
to
purchase
from
a
breeder
why
don't
you
go
through
animal
shelters
first
to
find
that
specific
breed
often
times
you
can
come
across
a
breed
specific
rescue
or
owner
surrendered
pets
who
bought
a
dog
for
the
looks
and
didn't
realize
how
much
of
a
responsibility
they
are
if
you're
hell
bent
on
purchasing
a
dog
for
god's
sakes
go
to
a
breeder
that
has
top
of
the
line
care
for
their
animals
and
isn't
a
backyard
breeder
sending
their
dogs
off
to
a
store
adopt
don't
shop
i
am
so
self
conscious
about
my
thighs
i
feel
like
a
look
like
a
cow
do
guys
hate
girls
with
some
thigh
and
not
just
skinny
mini
like
the
girls
soccer
team
94
a
young
lady
named
roshni
you're
the
most
beautiful
lady
i've
ever
met
in
my
life
and
i
only
have
one
question
in
my
mind
when
i
think
of
you
are
you
single
2667
is
it
kosher
to
submit
a
work
request
for
my
bed
squeaks
too
loudly
when
i
have
sex
and
i'm
reeeeeeally
not
tryna
wake
up
my
roommate
but
i'm
still
tryna
get
some
or
no
someone
just
sent
a
series
of
like
four
or
five
confessions
about
fashion
choices
can't
you
just
do
one
long
rant
and
get
it
over
with
the
transition
words
would
make
more
sense
too
11934
i
have
so
many
finals
to
study
for
and
papers
to
write
but
i
can't
stop
thinking
of
this
one
guy
i'm
crushing
on
how
do
i
stop
this
madness
for
many
different
reasons
one
being
family
i
was
not
able
to
attend
a
m
this
fall
i
am
at
a
pretty
good
school
not
well
known
and
its
smaller
about
"17,000"
students
but
its
still
good
i
was
hoping
to
transfer
for
fall
of
2014
over
here
i'm
a
chemistry
major
forensic
science
minor
my
classes
are
smaller
and
most
of
my
professors
know
me
i
have
a
4.0
and
because
of
the
way
the
classes
are
i
think
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
keep
my
4.0
here
i'm
also
in
honors
with
that
i
can
do
an
undergraduate
thesis
i've
always
wanted
to
go
to
a
m
but
i
also
understand
that
my
academic
record
would
probably
be
better
over
here
should
i
wait
and
transfer
after
i
take
my
ochem
and
physics
classes
here
should
i
transfer
in
the
fall
or
should
i
just
wait
and
go
to
a
m
for
grad
school
a
very
confused
student
5278
those
damn
feminists
maybe
women
had
a
choice
for
a
little
while
but
now
it's
just
a
standard
if
i
wasn't
expected
to
be
the
best
i
wouldn't
be
a
girl
busting
my
ass
in
engineering
right
now
i'd
be
sewing
pretty
little
girls
dresses
and
making
sure
dinner
is
ready
when
my
man
gets
home
would
that
really
be
so
bad
when
i
get
back
during
a
classic
blackout
i
always
fart
in
my
roommates
pillow
last
night
the
dragon
erupted
from
the
volcano
if
you
feel
me
15210
i'm
a
black
guy
who
can't
get
white
women
what
am
i
doing
wrong
i
think
that
my
penis
is
getting
smaller
is
this
normal
question
bus

at
the
tarrow
stop
headed
back
to
campus

any
other
ladies
had
an
awkward
experience
with
a
man
who
lives
in
the
house
by
it
coming
to
talk
to
you
every
time
i'm
at
that
stop
by
myself
he
comes
out
and
talks
to
me
it's
like
he's
sitting
there
waiting
is
this
just
me
or
do
any
other
girls
have
this
problem

around

in
the
asian

an
amazing

to
get

know
him
and
have

today
i
went
to
take
a
shower
and
noticed
that
there
was
dust
building
up
on
my
shampoo
bottle
is
this
a
sign
i
haven't
showered
enough
this
week
or
my
room
is
too
fucking
dirty
can
you
complain
if
you
find
a
hair
in
your
everything
bagel
are
there
any
athletic
sports
fitness
movement
based
clubs

could
join
with
little
experience
and
chronic
illness
fatigue
problems
i
have
fungus
on
my
feet
and
i
don't
want
to
cure
it
because
i
enjoy
the
relief
i
get
when
i
put
alcohol
on
my
feet
after
scratching
in
between
my
toes
until
they
bleed
is
that
weird
what
do
guys
think
of
a
19
year
old
female
virgin
cc
is
pretty
painful
to
be
at
most
of
the
time
are
there
any
other
straight
edge
people
we
can
start
a
club
thinking
about
getting
a
group
of
people
to
run
and
get
sexy
or
sexier
over
summer
anyone
interested
who
needs
to
think
when
your
feet
just
go

want
to
try
dating
women
but

feel
like
it's
unfair

questioning
so

may
or
may
not
legitimately
be
into
you
invest
your
time
and
energy
into
a
relationship
with
me
and
risk
me
turning
out
straight
anyway
cool
thx
i'm
so
confused

am
but

don't
want
to
use

3007
why
all
the
hate
on
premeds
yes
its
true
we're
competitive
but
that's
not
us
its
the
institution
also
when
you're
old
and
fat
and
dying
we're
the
ones
who
will
be
saving
your
ass
just
saying
chris
mayo
smith
why
haven't
i
ever
talked
to
you
you're
beautiful
227
why
are
you
going
to
walk
around
the
library
the
weekend
before
finals
and
talk
your
ass
off
shut

up

social
hour
here
1535
the
other
day
my
roommate
and
i
had
to
get
our
room
lock
changed
because
a
suite
mate
stole
our
keys
the
locksmith
let
himself
in
unexpectedly
and
saw
an
eighth
of
greens
on
our
common
room
table
instead
of
reporting
us
he
said
it's
just
a
little
herb
what's
that
going
to
do
to
you
then
he
proceeded
to
help
us
cover
our
smoke
detector
as
well
as
offer
to
smoke
us
down
to
say
the
very
least
getting
our
locks
changed
was
a
great
time
maybe
we
should
do
it
more
often
yesterday
all
my
troubles
seemed
so
far
away
now
it
looks
as
though
they're
here
to
stay
oh
i
believe
in
yesterday
why'd
he
have
to
go
i
don't
know
he
wouldn't
say
i
read
espn
and
now
i
long
for
yesterdayyyy
i
love
sex
sex
goes
through
my
mind
all
the
time
and
women
like
having
sex
with
me
too
because
of
my
enormous
junk
but
my
problem
is
exactly
that
i
can't
stop
thinking
of
sex
whenever
a
female
were
to
ask
me
hey
lets
go
fuck
i
would
say
hell
yea
except
when
we're
done
i
feel
disgusted
at
myself
and
just
want
to
crawl
in
a
hole
and
die
the
worst
part
is
that
i
finally
found
someone
i
wanted
to
have
a
committed
relationship
with
but
she's
a
virgin
and
i
can't
bring
myself
to
wanting
to
take
her
virginity
nor
do
i
want
to
cheat
on
her
so
i
had
to
end
things
with
her
am
i
bad
person
am
i
the
low
life
insect
of
society
all
i
ever
wanted
was
a
girlfriend
but
now
i
don't
even
know
anymore
380
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
big
player
and
i
used
to
have
sex
like
all
the
time
with
girls
i
didn't
even
care
about
i
have
had
terrible
relationships
in
the
past
and
a
troubled
past
and
i
just
don't
want
to
get
hurt
again
i
know
that
is
no
excuse
for
what
i
do
but
i
am
yearning
for
someone
who
love
me
for
me
but
honestly
i
want
to
have
just
one
girl
that
will
be
mine
and
me
hers
i
guess
i
am
just
afraid
i
am
currently
dating
this
girl
that
has
been
fairly
close
to
me
and
a
great
support
towards
me
but
i
don't
even
know
if
i
actually
like
her
because
i
just
keep
thinking
about
other
girls
or
more
like
my
fantasy
girl
there
was
this
one
girl
i
met
a
couple
months
ago
named
yuna
and
we
talked
a
couple
times
i
can
tell
she
is
the
most
genuine
person
at
this
school
that
i
have
met.i
still
remember
our
conversations
even
though
most
of
them
were
quite
brief
she
seems
to
have
gone
through
so
much
but
seems
to
just
keep
everything
locked
away
and
cares
so
much
about
others
i
haven't
seen
her
in
awhile
and
kind
of
forgot
about
her
but
i
just
saw
her
this
afternoon
again
on
the
b
bus
with
some
asian
boy
you
are
seriously
always
smiling
you
look
beautiful
when
you
smile
it
saddens
me
to
know
that
smile
was
probably
forced
i
think
you
are
just
looking
for
that
one
guy
to
love
you
and
help
you
get
over
your
past
pain
i
want
to
thank
you
for
helping
so
many
people
like
me
without
even
realizing
that
you
help
and
i
was
wondering
if
you
are
okay
i
probably
will
never
confront
you
about
this
and
i
am
sorry
i
just
want
to
let
you
know
that
it's
okay
to
be
upset
sometimes
and
not
smile
no
one
is
going
to
punish
you
for
being
happy
and
no
one
is
going
to
punish
you
for
being
sad
sory
i
know
this
is
pathetic
to
pretty
much
confess
that
i'm
attracted
towards
you
through
this
but
this
is
my
pathetic
way
of
making
sure
that
you
will
be
okay
you
have
seriously
been
the
only
thing
on
my
mind
the
whole
day
since
i
saw
you
you
seem
like
the
perfect
girl
you
are
nice
funny
outgoing
caring
and
beautiful
i
hope
to
maybe
see
you
again
and
maybe
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
again
although
brief
i
really
did
enjoy
our
other
conversations

dear
roommate
you
need
to
stop
being
so
damn
aggressive
it's
ruining
our
friendship
that
we've
had
since
freshman
year
i
get
that
you're
stressed
out
but
news
flash
so
are
the
rest
of
your
roommates
who
are
also
second
semester
seniors
act
like
the
polite
lady
i
know
you
can
be
received
ten
minutes
later
1283
to
my
roommate
apparently
you
love
the
rest
of
the
4
of
us
but
you
sure
haven't
been
acting
like
it
recently
you've
been
so
aggressive
that
i
don't
even
want
to
be
around
you
you
need
to
realize
that
your
hostility
is
hurting
all
of
our
friendships
with
you
you
say
that
you
wish
you
made
new
friends
freshman
year
well
you
might
have
another
opportunity
now
that
you're
hurting
us

that

didn't

farms

to
www.madisonconfessions.com
my
boyfriend
broke
my
heart
this
week
while
i
was
in
town
visiting
him
and
i
dont
know
how
i
can
move
on
he
cheated
on
me
and
broke
my
heart
after
a
year
of
being
together
he
went
running
back
to
his
girlfriend
that
he
was
only
with
for
6
months
after
he
repeatedly
used
to
tell
me
he
hated
her
and
never
wanted
anything
to
do
with
her
then
he
tells
me
he
hasnt
loved
me
for
a
long
time
and
so
has
been
lieing
to
me
for
a
long
time
i'm
so
torn
because
how
could
something
like
this
happen
to
me
i've
never
done
him
wrong
ever
in
my
life
i
wish
i
could
turn
back
time
and
that
this
would've
never
happened
where
did
i
do
wromg
i'm
so
hurt
i
no
longer
want
to
be
im
this
world
and
i
want
nothing
more
than
to
just
dissappear
i
want
someome
to
talk
to
amd
someome
to
help
me
get
over
him
i
need
help
before
things
seriously
go
wrong
on
behalf
of
all
men
i
want
to
make
a
sincere
apology
to
all
women
who
have
been
neglected
abused
mistreated
cheated
and
disrespected
in
relationships
also
i
am
speaking
to
the
women
who
just
can't
seem
to
find
the
right
guy
i
have
been
speaking
with
women
who
are
in
these
relationships
so
i
dedicate
this
to
you
all
for
being
so
strong
when
you
don't
even
know
that
you
are
relationships
should
be
a
comfort
zone
not
where
you
feel
uneasy
so
please
accept
this
apology
and

that

date
a

why
do
you
ask
me
what's
wrong
only
for
me
to
tell
you
and
then
you
stop
responding
you're
not
helping
you
just
make
me
feel
stupid
for
telling
you
okay
guys
please
explain
something
to
me
when
did
guys
stop
telling
girls
they
aren't
interested
in
them
when
did
it
become
a
social
norm
to
just
ignore
them
what
happened
to
common
decency
how
hard
is
it
to
tell
a
girl
hey
sorry
i
just
think
we
should
be
friends
shit
even
if
you
aren't
interested
in
a
girl
you
can
still
be
nice
cause
we
do
have
feelings
believe
it
or
not
treat
others
the
way
you
want
to
be
treated
just
curious
can
you
people
make
a
wild
guess
on
what
percent
of
engineering
guys
at
a
m
remain
virgin
and
haven't
had
a
single
relationship
till
their
graduation
day

dear

hoping
that
your
message
applies
to
me
but
who
wants
to
get
their
hopes
high
i
sure
don't
drop
a
hint
please
or
else
i'll
feel
like
an
ass
for
reaching
out
something
a
like
or
whatever
then
i'll
say
something
because
guess
what
though
there
has
been
0
contact
in
months
and
we
are
countries
apart
i
still
can't
seem
to
get
you
outta
my
head
no
matter
how
hard
i
try
or
you
can
reach
out
haha
cause
of
course
i'm
as
nervous
and
hesitant
as
you
are
to
the
does
it
bother
guys
if
a
girl
is
au
natural
down
there
and
the
guy
speaking
for
most
guys
no
you
are
wrong
shave
it
ladies
unless
you
don't
like
someone
going
down
on
you

night
my
penis
became

kept
it

people
might
complain
about
georgetown

being
superficial

privileged

whatnot
but
i
am
legitimately
curious
if
anyone
knows
what
it's
like
at
other
institutions
is
it
any
better
what
issues
do
other
schools
have

i
followed
the
most
beautiful
girl
you've
ever
seen
on
every
social
media
site
there
is
just
so
she
would
notice
me
i
dont
care
if
it
was
weird
because
she
rejects
every
guy
here
and
i
know
i
dont
have
a
chance
anyway
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
kind
of
guy
does
im
so
confused
in
real
life
i
am
a
normal
polite
even
sweet
gentleman
and
many
people
hated
and
feared
me
but
if
i
am
an
asshole
on
the
internet
the
same
people
bow
down
before
me
as
if
i
were
a
god
wat
do
that
awkward
moment
when
you're
taking
a
test
and
you
second
guess
your
self
because
the
same
answer
choice
has
shown
up
4
times
in
a
row
happen
to
any
body
else
todos

why
are
so
many
people
here
so
cynical
and
negative
yeah
we're
gonna
be
in
debt
for
a
while
yeah
there's
bureaucracy
but
so
what
if
college
was
easy
it
wouldn't
be
rewarding
or
worth
it
and
if
you
focus
on
all
the
negatives
you're
not
going
to
getting
the
most
out
of
your
time
here
and
this
is
clearly
a
secret
because
a
lot
of
you
don't
seem
to
get
this
are
there
any
guys
at
wake
that
like
extremely
kinky
sex
i
have
yet
to
find
one
i've
got
a
blindfold
and
handcuffs
waiting
in
my
room
i've
never
felt
this
lonely
in
my
life
i
have
good
friends
but
for
some
reason
i
just
can't
really
relate
to
them
i
feel
terrible
right
now
and
i
really
want
the
comfort
of
another
person
but
i
don't
want
any
of
my
friends
near
me
i
keep
feeling
like
there's
someone
i
can
reach
out
to
i've
even
gone
through
my
contacts
in
my
phone
but
nobody
on
this
campus
gets
me
the
way
i
want
them
to
it's
an
awful
feeling
to
realize
that
your
friendships
are
just
friendships
nothing
deeper
i
miss
the
connections
i
used
to
have
with
certain

this
is
more
of
a
question
than
a
confession
but
i
recently
made
a
tinder
account
and
i
was
wondering
how
the
whole
messaging
thing
works
i
mean
are
you
just
supposed
to
message
the
guy
or
wait
for
him
to
message
you
confused
girl
that
just
wants
to
make
some
guy
friends
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
very
solitary
person
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
form
lasting
relationships
due
to
the
dedication
it
requires
but
lately
i've
been
starting
to
feel
like
i
want
someone
to
be
there
thing
is
i've
felt
this
way
before
and
when
i
act
upon
it
i
end
up
hurting
the
person
because
again
i
am
a
very
solitary
person
and
suddenly
need
a
lot
of
space
what
do
i
do
i
don't
want
to
hurt
anyone
but
that
includes
myself
and
sometimes
it
difficult
being
alone
im
mixed
hispanic
and
white
and
95
of
the
time
i
get
hit
on
by
guys
its
because
they
say
i
have
a
nice
black
girl
ass
and
it
is
black
guys
that
hit
on
me
i
have
only
dated
black
guys
just
because
they
are
the
only
ones
who
have
ever
shown
interest
is
a
size
7
considered
fat
i
feel
that
my
size
is
whats
turning
off
guys
that
or
maybe
i'm
just
ugly
i
seriously
hate
when
people
tell
depressed
suicidal
people
that
life
gets
better
and
that
it's
always
darkest
before
the
dawn
and
other
cheesy
ass
bullshit
you
know
what
to
them
life
isn't
beautiful
and
their
storm
will
probably
never
end
stop
trying
to
make
this
world
all
happy
go
lucky

make
it
a
better
place

is

what's
up
with
all

fat
shaming
on

page
i
sincerely
think
each
one
of
you
is
even
more
beautiful
than
the
other
no
matter
what's
your
shape
i
cannot
express
how
glad
i
am
simply
by
witnessing
people
who
are
happy
healthy
and
comfortable
with
who
they
are
if
i
had
any
of
you
guys
body
i'd
be
soooo
proud
simply
cause
it's
beau
ti
ful
and
functioning
to
a
certain
extent
i
guess
this
applies
to
every
single
one
of
you
out
there
sincerely
the
creep
who
spends
his
day
checking
you
out
p
to
the
person
who
said
white
people
can't
say
the
n
word
okay
so
i'm
going
to
rant
about
this
a
little
bit
i
went
to
a
black
predominant
school
in
elementary
and
high
school
and
you
know
what
i
hate
it
when
black
people
say
the
n
word
why
because
if
a
black
person
says
it
why
not
a
white
guy
i'm
asian
and
you
don't
see
us
saying
oh
hey
chink
or
other
races
call
themselves
what
ever
negative
race
word
implies
to
them
its
stupid
so
your
confession
should
really
be
hey
black
friends
maybe
if
we
stop
using
the
n
word
then
other
people
will
stop
using
it
to
d
the
jokes
on
you
on
a
side

forward

also
showing
that
if
he
doesn't

it's
fine
we
can
still
be
friends
i
only
see
him
sometimes
he's
flirty
nice
but
i
don't
know
of
that
means
he
likes
me
more
than
a
friend
or
of
he
just
feels
comfortable
flirting

we
have
known
each
ther

my
pretty
awesome
texas
a
m
seal
frame
up
on
sale
for
150
from
texas
aggie
bookstore
back
in
the
day
when
it
was
my
time

already
spent
probably
close
to
80
100k
between
the
degree
cost
of
living
out
here
bills
vehicle
blah
blah
blah
so
spring
another
150
200
or
go
to
hobby
lobby
michaels
and
buy
a
picture
frame
about
the
size
of
your
diploma
a
little
bigger
some
nice
matting
and
use
a
razor
blade
to
cut
the
matting
out
yourself
and
frame
your
own
diploma
options
op
options
christians
are
so
hypocritical
i
thought
y'all
were
supposed
to
wait
til
marriage
to
have
sex
and
then
y'all
frown
upon
people
passing
out
condoms
wtf
why
doesn't
anybody
like
t.o
walton
hall
why
do
they
have
to
be
considered
that
dorm
why
can't
i
ever
feel
pretty
the
guys
always
go
for
my
friends
and
i
am
just
along
for
the
ride

breasts

your
entire

he's
an
angel
and
i'm
a
hellion
why
do
i
have
to
like
someone
way
to
good
for
me
1889
trigger
warning
disordered
eating
i've
been
doing
really
well
with
my
recovery
especially
this
summer
but
my
friend
from
home
just
visited
and
they
tend
to
fat
shame
people
a
lot
i
tried
asking
them
to
stop
and
pointed
out
why
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
being
fat
but
to
be
honest
their
words
had
a
pretty
strong
impact
on
me
i
know
intellectually
that
adipose
is
harmless
and
i
think
it's
pretty
on
other
people
but
right
now
i'm
just
ashamed
of
my
body
i
feel
like
i
should
hide
it
lest
i
offend
people
like
my
friend
was
i
completely
out
of
touch
before
are
most
people
really
so
disgusted
by
fat
that
i
should
be
concerned
that
everyone
is
judging
my
slightly
above
average
mass
i
love
my
friend
but
i
think
i
might
have
to
stop
hanging
out
with
them
it's
just
to
painful
so
if
you
have
sex
with
siamese
twins
does
it
count
as
a
threesome
or
is
it
like
a
2.5some
my
boyfriend
and
i
have
been
going
out
for
3
1
2
years
now
he's
my
high
school
sweetheart
and
we
just
started
having
sex
during
the
winter
break
he's
had
experience
before
but
i
lost
my
virginity
to
him
when
i'm
laying
on
my
back
and
he's
kissing
all
over
me
and
doing
his
job
i
literally
have
no
clue
what
to
do
other
than
make
noises
and
run
my
hands
over
his
back
what
are
girls
usually
supposed
to
do
in
that
position
can
we
all
just
go
figure
skating
it
makes
life
easier
1808
at
the
crosswalk
bike
circle
on
el
colegio
rd
right
before
campus
there's
this
street
sign
that
says
caution
blind
pedestrian
which
always
makes
me
wonder
two
things
1
so
there's
only
one
blind
pedestrian
2
when
this
person
used
the
crosswalk
is
he
she
at
all
aware
that
there's
a
sign
calling
them
out
individually
above
his
or
her
head
i'm
a
straight
guy
and
all
but
i
cannot
freaking
stand
the
smell
of
a
woman's
vagina
or
anything
that
resembles
it
it's
just
overly
sweet
and
downright
disgusting
how
do
other
guys
stand
this
do
you
think
i
have
a
chance
with
that
freshman
in
mathias
named
sophie
i
think
she's
from
nevada
or
something
i
genuinely
had
this
conversation
yesterday
me
oh
hey
where
are
you
from
girl
texas
you
know
the
state
13092
in
response
to
13080
who's
arguing
against
the
statistics
about
frat
culture
being
rape
culture
you
claim
that
rape
only
occurs
in
the
greek
system
because
there
are
more
parties
in
the
greek
system
so
the
greek
culture
leads
to
more
parties
and
more
parties
leads
to
more
rape
so
isn't
that
saying
that
the
greek
culture
is
in
fact
conducive
to
rape
culture
you
dismiss
the
problem
by
claiming
that
those
horrifying
statistics
come
about
just
because
these
are
the
people
that
are
generally
in
situations
where
things
can
go
wrong
that's
the
problem
though
the
greek
system
should
be
actively
taking
steps
to
ensure
that
there
are
no
such
situations
where
things
can
go
wrong
you
can
still
party
obviously
but
drinking
to
the
point
of
making
these
dumb
decisions
and
creating
a
culture
where
objectifying
women
is
even
considered
acceptable
public
behavior
see
the
jugs
fundraiser
is
not
necessary
and
needs
to
change
now
the
problem
is
not
partying
itself
you
can
party
without
raping
people
i
would
love
to
see
a
greek
leader
coming
forward
publicly
and
take
actual
steps
to
mitigate
this
problem
instead
of
brushing
it
under
the
bed
saying
it's
not
us
the
party
made
us
do
it
true
not
all
greeks
buy
into
this
dangerous
culture
but
some
do
and
that's
the
problem
i
guess
freshman
year
has
been
a
disappointment
in
some
sense
if
only
because
i
thought
i
would
have
an
amazing
group
of
lifelong
friends
by
now
and
that
hasn't
really
materialized
i
have
a
lot
of
acquaintances
nice
intelligent
people
who
i
see
around
and
hang
out
with
occasionally
but
i
don't
have
close
friends
who
i
can
call
up
whenever
and
have
fun
with
kind
of
a
bummer
given
how
long
it's
been
since
august
ya
know
are
there
any
tips
for
asian
right
the
pale
ones
males
to
impress
american
females
get
ripped
drive
a
lexus
suggestion
needed
really
thanks
873
if
i
show
you
my
scars
would
you
think
any
less
of
me
am
i
an
asshole
4507
it's
really
hard
and
annoying
to
go
to
a
restaurant
with
someone
who's
too
fucking
cheap
to
spend
and
tip
she
posts
pictures
on
instagram
about
all
these
nice
and
fancy
expensive
places
she
goes
to
eat
but
when
we
go
out
she
starts
getting
cheap
all
of
the
girls
in
the
group
always
takes
turns
getting
the
check
except
for
her
i
don't
kno
what
to
do
with
her
anymore
i'm
not
about
the
life
of
fast
food
restaurants
for
dinner
either
but
how
do
i
tell
her
to
stop
being
so
fucking
cheap
so
i
have
no
date
for
valentines
day
and
i
couldn't
care
less
what
does
upset
me
is
that
i
hardly
have
any
friends
and
the
friends
i
do
have
all
have
dates
so
i
have
nothing
to
do
its
not
that
im
not
social
im
outgoing
and
talk
to
people
all
the
time
i
just
dont
drink
and
pretty
much
anytime
i
go
hang
out
with
no
people
they
get
obliterated
drunk
and
never
leave
me
alone
regarding
the
fact
that
i
refuse
to
drink
so
i
stop
hanging
out
with
them
i
have
yet
to
make
a
single
friend
that
i
didnt
know
prior
to
moving
here
i
only
have
out
with
about
6
people
iys
like
there
is
no
one
in
cstat
who
will
just
hang
out
go
grab
a
bite
to
eat
and
just
have
a
night
at
home
with
friends
i
dont
wanna
get
shit
faced
every
night
anyone
out
there
who
would
just
hang
out
with
a
freshman
guy
play
some
xbox
or
just
go
out
for
some
lunch
or
something

15578
people

complaining
about
admin
and
regular

comments
in

don't
really
hate

break
it

you

not
revolve
around
your
whims
scroll
past
what
you
don't
want
to
read
don't
blame
other
people
because
your
lack
of
self
control
typically
results
in
your
annoyance
that
shit
is
your
fault

all
these
comments
trying
to
guess
who
the
confessor
is
sorta
piss
me
off
i
get
it
for
the
myriad
joke
posts
but
for
the
ones
that
are
actual
confessions
can
we
not
do
this
i
realize
it's
nigh
impossible
to
actually
guess
who
it
is
but
it
seems
like
a
total
disrespect
to
their
privacy
they
came
here
to
get
something
off
their
chest
without
everyone
and
their
mothers
knowing
who
it
is
can
we
just
leave
them
be
or
even
better
try
and
at
least
offer
help
consolation
whatever
the
situation
demands
props
to
those
guys
and
gals
who
already
do
that
by
the
way
y'all
should
be
proud
of
yourselves
i'm
tired
of
the
lack
of
confessions
and
just
straight
bitching
wining
ranting
about
abortions
rape
politics
blah
blah
blah
so
here's
confession
not
a
scandalous
one
a
just
for
fun
one
anytime
i
masturbate
i
think
about
me
giving
a
guy
i
know
head
i
just
think
about
me
going
to
town
on
him
and
when
i
get
through
with
that
round
i'll
put
on
some
porn
but
i'll
only
watch
the
parts
where
she's
going
down
on
the
guy
and
the
actress
has
to
match
my
hair
color
it's
like
i'm
pretending
i'm
watching
me
do
it
yes
i'm
a
girl
i
don't
know
if
that's
weird
but
it
works
every
time
i've
woken
my
past
exes
up
with
blow
jobs
i've
stopped
them
mid
day
all
because
i
like
to
do
it
i
really
like
to
do
it
i
guess
it's
an
oral
fetish
but
i
don't
really
know
because
if
i
go
to
work
on
a
guy
i
don't
feel
like
he
has
to
pay
me
back
i'd
rather
just
do
it
ya
know
like
that
gets
me
off
more
than
him
doing
anything
to
me
does
before
you
say
i
haven't
had
a
guy
do
it
right
i'll
stop
you
there
i
have
they
have
o's
all
around
but
i
think
it's
more
about
the
power
like
some
girls
see
getting
on
your
knees
and
blowing
a
guy
as
demeaning
but
ladies
when
you're
down
there
and
he's
moaning
your
name
take
into
account
who's
really
in
control
of
that
situation
hint
not
him
the
only
demeaning
part
of
that
whole
process
is
getting
up
walking
to
the
bathroom
spitting
in
the
sink
and
swishing
your
mouth
out
and
having
to
walk
back
into
the
room
so
just
don't
spit
856
i
think
it's
unnecessary
for
people
to
comment
negative
things
about
a
person's
confession
they
confessed
here
anonymously
as
an
outlet
for
something
that
was
bothering
them
not
so
that
they
could
have
their
character
judged
or
have
accusations
made
against
them
next
time
you
find
yourself
making
a
judgment
about
the
author
of
a
certain
post
realize
that
what
they
wrote
is
one
tiny
part
of
who
they
are
and
that
you
will
never
know
anything
else
about
the
person
therefore
how
can
you
judge
them
accurately
even
if
you
do
believe
that
you
can
pass
valid
judgments
on
these
anonymous
confessors
look
at
yourself
and
realize
that
you
are
not
perfect
either
and
surely
there
are
things
that
you
feel
ashamed
of
or
that
you
would
only
confess
anonymously
as
well
i'm
so
mad
that
i
couldn't
hook
up
with
sanjay
roberts
this
weekend
can
you
just
be
mine
this
guy's
walking
down
the
street
when
he
falls
in
a
hole
the
walls
are
so
steep
he
can't
get
out
a
doctor
passes
by
and
the
guy
shouts
up
hey
you
can
you
help
me
out
the
doctor
writes
a
prescription
throws
it
down
in
the
hole
and
moves
on
then
a
priest
comes
along
and
the
guy
shouts
up
father
i'm
down
in
this
hole
can
you
help
me
out
the
priest
writes
out
a
prayer
throws
it
down
in
the
hole
and
moves
on
then
a
friend
walks
by
hey
joe
it's
me
can
you
help
me
out
and
the
friend
jumps
in
the
hole
our
guy
says
are
you
stupid
now
we're
both
down
here
the
friend
says
yeah
but
i've
been
down
here
before
and
i
know
the
way
out
i
wanted
to
share
this
quote
with
anyone
at
rice
having
a
tough
time
because
we
are
not
all
as
happy
as
the
princeton
review
says
there's
a
guy
named
taylor
in
my
class
he's
from
england
but
went
to
american
school
and
he's
very
cute
looking
how
do
i
find
him
and
is
he
single
my
boyfriend
makes
me
promise
that
i'll
never
break
up
with
him
on
a
daily
basis
this
can't
be
normal
right
4124
one
time
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
class
and
the
final
was
to
kill
yourself
or
you
fail
out
of
cornell
how
many
perfectionists
would
choose
one
or
the
other
and
then
i
thought
of
our
suicide
history
and
put
myself
in
time
out
i
hate
the
organization
i
am
in
it's
like
high
school
all
over
again
and
everyone
has
their
own
clique
thing
is
i
can't
get
out
of
the
organization
since
i
already
paid
dues
and
have
committed
to
it
and
i'm
not
one
to
just
drop
something
because
everyone
else
segregates
themselves
into
cliques
it's
just
ridiculous
i've
always
been
the
new
guy
and
have
always
fit
right
in
but
cliques
nope
are
there
any
noncliquey
organizations
on
campus
can't
seem
to
find
any
by
the
way
not
a
frat
in
case
you
were
wondering
3678
how
do
you
meet
girls
if
you
don't
drink
party
i
am
hesitant
to
use
the
cornell
singles
page
or
something
because
i
don't
want
to
seem
desperate
to
all
my
friends
who
see
me
join
the
group
i
had
a
couple
almost
relationships
since
coming
here
but
nothing
panned
out
and
now
i
feel
stuck
within
my
mostly
taken
friend
group
thoughts
how
do
you
all
do
it
9045
i
hate
reading
confessions
about
girls
who
are
with
guys
who
mistreat
them
i
don't
have
a
girlfriend
and
haven't
had
one
for
a
while
but
if
i
did
i
would
treat
her
so
well
it
pains
me
inside
to
see
how
guys
treat
girls
on
this
campus
what
ever
happened
to
the
definition
of
being
a
man
would
you
rather
munch
the
box
of
a
girl
you
find
repulsive
for
30
minutes
or
have
her
eat
your
asshole
for
2
hours
okay
i
know
this
might
sound
homophobic
but
im
not
but
is
it
me
or
do
all
gay
people
act
the
same
i
mean
i
haven't
met
one
who
isnt
in
theater
or
musicals
and
theyre
all
so
effeminate
im
for
gay
marriage
dont
get
me
wrong
but
god
get
the
fuck
over
yourselves
quit
getting
offended
at
every
little
thing
its
honestly
pathetic
so
get
over
yourselves
if
you
were
tougher
more
people
would
support
you
4488
every
time
nyu
sends
me
a
bursar
email
saying
your
financial
aid
has
been
revised
i
get
an
anxiety
attack
this
is
really
not
good
for
my
blood
pressure
can
i
sue
for
unnecessary
distress
where
are
all
the
a
m
skaters
at
i
skate
on
a
daily
basis
and
never
see
another
skater
am
i
alone
long
boarders
don't
count
7613
i'm
the
type
of
person
that
people
like
at
first
but
when
they
get
to
know
me
more
they
stop
caring
what's
wrong
with
me
it's
like
my
first
impression
is
my
best
impression
and
it
just
goes
downhill
from
there
i
have
tons
of
acquaintances
but
no
real
friends
the
only
friends
i
have
are
guys
that
are
trying
to
get
in
my
pants
and
even
then
as
they
get
to
know
me
more
they
like
me
less
and
less
i
don't
know
how
to
form
close
friendships
with
girls
idk
everything
just
always
seems
superficial
and
fake
i'm
so
jealous
of
girls
that
have
seemingly
close
girl
friends
i
wish
i
could
figure
out
how
they
do
it

my

watch
v
rqbh3fygere
is
it
possible
to
go
too
balls
to
the
wall
at
sym
cause
i'm
worried
i
might
and
people
will
judge
me
2230
to
the
really
tall
girl
from
new
south
i
think
your
name
is
dolly
if
you're
cool
with
dating
short
guys
i
would
love
to
take
you
out
sometime
you
are
genuinely
drop
dead
gorgeous
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
know
you
better
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
peeping
tom
look
kinda
like
shane
from
the
walking
dead
thoughts
on
straight
girls
with
short
hair
attractive
terrible
tl
dr
ranting
about
my
ex
and
how
fucked
up
it
is
that
i
let
such
an
unappreciative
person
have
my
fucking
heart
you
know
what
i
just
have
to
get
this
off
my
fucking
chest
yeah
i
said
it
you
were
one
of
the
biggest
mistakes
of
my
life
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
it
sound
like
that
it's
entirely
your
fault
i
didn't
have
to
let
you
in
to
my
fragile
little
world
i
didn't
have
to
hold
on
to
my
feelings
for
you
i
didn't
have
to
deal
with
your
bullshit
but
i
did
because
what
i
felt
for
you
was
real
i
really
really
fucking
loved
you
and
i
still
care
about
you
i
care
about
what
happens
to
you
we
used
to
be
best
friends
for
life
before
we
started
a
relationship
and
now
we're
just
nothing
just
strangers
again
but
that's
not
my
issue
i
can
deal
with
that
i'm
fine
without
you
i
sometimes
go
to
your
facebook
and
scroll
through
and
look
at
pictures
of
you
and
feel
nothing
i
mean
there's
some
sadness
but
not
emptiness
i
miss
you
but
not
painfully
so
i
guess
this
is
what
happens
when
you
feel
like
the
majority
of
it
all
was
a
lie
that
you
weren't
feeling
as
much
as
you
led
me
on
to
believe
you
fucked
up
and
you
lied
about
it
and
came
clean
about
it
months
after
months
that's
manipulative
as
fuck
how
could
i
ever
trust
you
again
i
don't
care
about
your
reasoning
behind
it
it
was
selfish
and
you
know
it
don't
tell
me
that
it
was
because
you
didn't
want
to
hurt
me
because
you
know
what
i
know
that
if
you
came
clean
about
it
in
the
first
place
that
would
have
hurt
way
less
than
having
to
deal
with
you
breaking
up
with
me
yet
still
sticking
around
and
trying
to
make
something
work
then
finally
telling
me
the
truth
and
me
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
what
to
believe
i
felt
that
we
had
made
so
much
progress
at
that
point
we
couldn't
just
stop
but
it
should
have
stopped
i
should
have
told
you
to
fuck
right
off
because
if
you
were
lying
about
that
you
could
have
been
lying
about
anything
and
everything
and
it
was
nice
to
hear
that
you
were
telling
our
friend
the
one
i
had
to
hear
about
you
being
in
love
with
when
i
was
starting
to
really
like
you
and
fall
for
you
you
fucking
idiot
weren't
sure
if
i
was
the
one
you
wanted
to
be
with
from
her
boyfriend
because
he
was
suspicious
as
fuck
about
you
and
i
think
he's
justified
in
it
because
i'm
definitely
suspicious
as
fuck
about
you
now
and
even
though
i
wasn't
told
about
this
until
after
i
broke
up
with
you
that
stabbed
me
in
the
fucking
heart
that
pissed
me
the
fuck
off
like
you're
a
liar
i
opened
up
to
you
and
did
my
very
best
to
make
you
feel
like
you
could
be
honest
with
me
too
and
you
just
completely
shit
on
that
you
took
advantage
of
my
trust
and
my
love
and
you
know
what
you
were
a
total
dick
to
me
and
i
didn't
deserve
that
quite
frankly
i
gave
you
my
all
i
gave
you
every
single
chance
i
could
muster
for
you
i
was
patient
i
was
sincere
as
for
you
i
have
no
idea
i
believe
that
you
were
devastated
when
i
ended
it
but
as
for
why
exactly
i
have
no
idea
it
could
be
anything
but
i
don't
buy
into
this
notion
that
it
was
because
you
were
so
sure
that
you
loved
me
and
wanted
to
be
with
me
i
just
think
that's
a
typical
reaction
of
someone
who's
experiencing
loss
i'm
so
glad
that
i
met
someone
and
that
i
immediately
liked
him
and
that
we
kind
of
clicked
although
i
know
something
may
never
happen
with
this
guy
because
you
know
life
and
because
i'm
a
bit
emotionally
unhinged
and
insecure
and
unable
to
trust
at
the
same
level
as
i
used
to
but
it
just
snapped
me
out
of
it
so
i
ended
it
and
saw
things
our
relationship
for
what
it
was
shitty
and
deceitful
i
fucked
up
but
i
told
you
about
it
the
next
day
because
i
knew
you
deserved
to
know
and
of
course
you
blew
up
at
me
but
then
you
said
one
magical
word
apathetic
then
i
was
just
done
i
didn't
want
it
anymore
i
didn't
want
you
anymore
and
it
wasn't
because
i
wanted
someone
more
than
i
wanted
you
i
just
simp
when
are
they
going
to
invent
yoga
shorts
so
that
we
can
continue
our
ass
gazing
during
the
summer
under
the
cover
of
shades
of
course
im
a
attractive
male
engineer
and
have
graduated
why
is
it
that
when
i
say
i
work
in
the
oil
field
girls
automatically
think
i
work
on
a
oil
rig
and
dont
make
money
do
they
not
understand
how
much
a
engineer
in
the
oil
industry
makes
seems
like
every
time
i
tell
them
what
i
do
they
take
it
as
a
turn
off
or
something
just
dont
get
it
can
we
just
tear
down
this
page
am
i
the
only
one
who
is
freaking
out
about
this
plane
that
vanished
into
thin
air
wake
up
america
as
a
brunette
when
i
go
to
harry's
with
my
blonde
roommate
i
feel
like
i
could
be
wearing
absolutely
nothing
and
guys
still
wouldn't
ask
me
to
dance
what's
a
girl
got
to
do
i
have
a
lot
of
twitter
followers
that
i
want
to
meet
but
how
do
i
do
it
without
being
creepy
especially
the
female
ones
i'd
feel
like
a
creep
asking
to
hang
out
or
something
5060
is
it
just
me
or
has
the
quality
of
drinks
and
customer
service
in
uncommon
grounds
taken
a
major
hit
this
year
the
coffee
tea
takes
a
lot
longer
to
be
made
than
in
past
years
and
the
employees
don't
even
seem
to
apologize
when
they
know
you've
been
waiting
a
while
why
is
it
that
i
never
see
any
interracial
couples
down
here
i'm
white
and
my
boyfriend
is
mexican
and
i
feel
like
were
the
only
ones

your
family
loves
you
sure
but
is
that
because
they
love
you
the
you
that
has
dreams
and
nightmares
and
imagines
doing
things
and
does
do
things
or
is
it
because
they
love
you
the
son
or
brother
that
exists
as
a
part
of
their
mental
family
the
person
who
exists
because
they
have
a
brother
or
a
son
that
needs
to
fit
a
silhouette
on
the
wall
that
fills
in
the
space
that's
supposed
to
be
filled
by
the
idea
they
have
of
their
family
i
ask
questions
about
their
work
what
do
you
do
what
does
quantum
string
theory
have
to
do
with
waffles
why
does
a
construction
company
need
a
geologist
but
nobody
ever
asks
me
what
an
omnicient
morality
license
is
or
why
a
film
needs
a
certain
type
of
plot
or
what
my
most
recent
book
is
about
or
cares
about
the
stories
i
love
to
imagine
nobody
cares
about
the
music
i
listen
to
or
why
i
only
listen
to
sad
piano
melodies
or
cares
why
i
want
to
learn
a
certain
type
of
music
on
that
piano
or
why
i
listen
to
epic
music
on
youtube
or
why
i
want
to
do
anything
no
they
ask
how
college
is
going
and
why
i
don't
have
a
girlfriend
yet
and
why
i
don't
seem
to
care
about
anything
that
i
do
why
should
i
care
nobody
else
does
sometimes
i
think
that
if
there
were
just
one
person
that
really
cared
that
i
could
talk
with
openly
and
freely
about
everything
in
my
life
no
matter
what
that
could
talk
to
me
and
joke
and
laugh
and
do
things
with
that
was
just
fun
to
be
around
and
always
brightened
my
day
even
when
it
was
as
bad
as
it
could
possibly
be
that
i'd
go
into
the
depths
of
hell
for
them
not
necessarily
to
get
them
out
though
that
would
obviously
be
the
first
priority
but
just
to
be
there
with
them
because
not
being
with
them
being
alone
anywhere
else
would
be
worse
than
braving
hell
for
them
and
just
because
i
don't
have
a
person
like
that
doesn't
make
those
feelings
any
different
oh
sure
you
laugh
and
you
joke
and
you
hope
that
the
next
person
you
see
will
be
them
but
each
disappointment
each
failed
chance
just
makes
you
draw
further
and
further
into
yourself
until
the
person
the
rest
of
the
world
experiences
is
just
some
caricature
of
who
you
really
are
this
two
dimensional
version
of
yourself
without
any
depth
and
that
has
stopped
hiding
its
feelings
and
no
longer
feels
anything
at
all
and
after
a
while
that
posterboard
of
yourself
is
all
that's
left
just
a
shell
with
no
heart
and
no
soul
just
a
bright
smile
over
a
black
abyss
that
used
to
be
you
that's
what
i
feel
like
not
only
at
5
in
the
morning
like
when
i'm
writing
this
when
tiredness
and
strain
and
lies
have
cracked
the
shell
until
only
the
hole
is
left
but
all
the
time
hiding
in
the
little
hints
at
the
edge
of
your
eyes
and
the
crease
in
your
smile
in
the
laugh
that
is
a
fraction
of
a
second
shorter
than
it
should
have
been
in
the
jokes
that
are
a
bit
too
self
deprecating
a
bit
too
hostile
to
a
hostile
world
always
sitting
and
waiting
to
come
out
like
a
wild
animal
spitting
at
the
light
and
the
only
thing
you
have
left
to
worry
about
everything
else
destroyed
because
you
no
longer
worry
about
what's
become
impossible
is
that
eternal
worry
that
if
you
ever
did
have
that
stroke
of
luck
that
tiny
piece
of
fortune
that
leads
you
to
that
perfect
person
that
you'll
no
longer
be
the
man
you
used
to
be
that
you'll
be
broken
so
badly
that
not
even
the
perfect
piece
of
the
puzzle
can
ever
fit
and
they'll
run
off
afraid
afraid
of
their
own
future
like
you
off
to
find
another
puzzle
piece
that
fits
not
quite
as
well
as
you
would
have
but
better
now
better
then
forever
than
you
that's
what
i'm
afraid
of
not
because
i
see
it
in
the
future
because
i
see
it
here
today
in
my
own
eyes
in
the
mirror
in
the
looks
on
your
faces
in
the
words
on
the
screen
in
the
f
cking
clouds
in
the
sky
in
the
sun
in
the
day
that
looks
like
blood
on
water
like
the
moon
which
no
longer
seems
to
be
beautiful
but

i
really
need
advice
on
a
problem
i
have
suspected
for
some
time
now
that
my
wife
has
been
cheating
on
me
the
usual
signs
if
the
phone
rings
and
i
answer
the
caller
hangs
up
she
goes
out
with
the
girls
a
lot
i
try
to
stay
awake
to
look
out
for
her
when
she
comes
home
but
i
usually
fall
asleep
anyway
last
night
about
midnight
i
hid
in
the
garage
behind
the
mustang
when
she
came
home
she
got
out
of
someone's
car
buttoning
her
blouse
then
she
took
her
panties
out
of
her
purse
and
slipped
them
on
it
was
at
that
moment
while
i
was
crouched
behind
the
mustang
that
i
noticed
a
hairline
crack
in
the
rear
shock
mounting
bracket
is
that
something
i
can
weld
or
do
i
need
to
replace
the
whole
bracket
howdy
first
id
like
to
start
off
by
saying
that
i
am
today
and
every
other
day
proud
to
call
myself
a
fightin
texas
aggie
having
said
that
i
am
reminded
of
all
the
things
that
carries
with
it
when
i
introduce
myself
to
other
people
yes
it
comes
with
aggie
jokes
and
the
general
rivalry
comments
that
come
up
when
you
tell
people
this
but
when
someone
asks
me
if
i
enjoy
it
at
texas
a
m
there
is
only
ever
one
answer
i
wouldnt
go
anywhere
else
then
the
follow
up
whys
that
i
always
give
the
same
answer
because
texas
a
m
is
different
its
a
university
where
students
will
stop
their
lives
the
first
tuesday
of
each
month
to
honor
a
fellow
student
at
silver
taps
its
a
university
where
you
can
greet
someone
with
a
howdy
and
theyll
say
it
right
back
and
most
of
all
because
above
all
else
we
are
there
for
each
other
and
that
is
shown
day
in
and
day
out
in
most
cases
in
the
past
few
days
many
things
have
been
said
about
aggies
by
other
aggies
and
it
is
downright
ridiculous
to
be
specific
as
to
what
im
talking
about
im
addressing
the
incident
involving
the
fish
camp
which
went
to
bonfire
memorial
to
take
its
camp
pictures
now
in
full
disclosure
i
have
been
involved
in
fish
camp
as
a
counselor
but
i
also
have
a
deep
love
for
the
bonfire
and
the
history
tragedy
and
spirit
it
stands
as
a
reminder
of
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
that
the
pictures
didnt
enrage
me
when
i
saw
them
and
still
at
this
point
almost
a
full
day
later
it
irks
me
to
no
end
that
a
group
of
people
who
would
seek
to
teach
incoming
freshmen
of
the
traditions
of
this
university
would
act
with
such
irreverence
towards
one
of
the
most
solemn
memorials
on
our
campus
i
will
not
defend
their
actions
because
they
are
indefensible
and
the
directing
staff
should
take
full
measures
to
correct
the
damage
done
but
the
damage
is
done
the
hurt
is
felt
and
this
cannot
be
undone
so
as
aggies
i
call
on
every
one
of
us
to
take
a
beat
and
instead
of
jumping
on
either
bandwagon
learn
from
what
was
done
on
both
sides
and
make
an
impression
on
the
incoming
class
that
fish
camp
is
meant
to
serve
that
we
as
aggies
do
not
tear
each
other
down
but
we
build
each
other
up
and
learn
from
each
other
even
if
that
means
putting
aside
our
anger
for
the
time
being
and
teaching
others
the
importance
of
the
many
facets
of
our
university
i
leave
you
with
something
said
after
the
tragedy
of
bonfire
in
1999
by
the
vice
student
body
president
for
the
university
of
texas
aggieland
is
a
special
place
with
special
people
now
i
know
its
hard
to
say
about
a
t
sip
but
he
was
right
aggieland
is
a
special
place
and
its
through
the
love
and
acceptance
we
show
one
another
despite
our
flaws
and
differences
which
allows
us
to
continue
the
tradition
that
has
been
with
us
since
the
day
our
doors
opened
in
1876
the
tradition
of
the
aggie
spirit
gig
em
and
god
bless
i
wish
you'd
give
me
some
small
clue
about
what
you're
up
to
on
fb
how
long
before
its
acceptable
to
call
somebody
just
because
two
weeks
7224
i
got
a
pretty
large
tattoo
a
few
months
ago
and
while
i
don't
regret
it
i
feel
like
everyone
immediately
judges
me
on
it
it's
pretty
visible
when
i'm
at
the
gym
and
i
notice
people
covertly
staring
at
me
all
the
time
multiple
times
i've
not
hooked
up
with
a
girl
solely
because
she
was
scared
and
thought
i
was
some
sort
of
low
life
monster
once
she
saw
it
on
the
flip
side
the
only
reason
i
had
a
chance
with
the
hottest
girl
i've
hooked
up
with
in
my
life
was
that
she
thought
my
tattoo
was
really
sexy
i've
also
felt
like
even
my
friends
have
changed
their
opinions
of
me
since
i
got
it
why
can't
someone
just
get
a
piece
of
artwork
on
their
body
to
express
themselves
without
being
judged

zomg
quesadilla
man
i've
always
wanted
to
ask
you
over
the
four
years
we've
seen
you
here
do
you
recognize
remember
students
year
to
year
or
just
the
semester
regulars
it's
a
lot
of
faces
i
know
also
what's
it
feel
like
knowing
that
a
significant
percentage
of
the
student
population
is
crushing
on
you
those
tattoos
are
fuckin
awesome
i
can't
help
but
stare
fangirlseverywhere
407
im
a
freshmen
weighing
230
pounds
and
im
really
trying
to
lose
this
weight
can
anyone
tell
me
what
to
do
to
lost
atleast
40
by
the
beginning
of
next
semester
677
wow
these
posts
are
incredibly
pathetic
it
is
sad
that
there
are
people
here
who
don't
know
and
can't
even
comprehend
what
real
adversity
is
who
the
hell
tries
to
kill
themselves
because
of
a
prelim
grade
who
the
hell
gets
depressed
so
easily
just
because
a
guy
doesn't
like
them
grow
up
want
to
know
what
real
adversity
is
my
parents
abandoned
me
before
i
was
born
so
i
became
an
orphan
i
grew
up
living
in
a
household
with
a
total
income
of
below
10k
well
below
the
poverty
line
and
routinely
had
no
heat
in
the
winter
and
no
ac
in
the
summer
guess
what
i
didn't
cry
or
pout
or
get
depressed
i
worked
my
ass
off
and
got
into
cornell
i
don't
drink
go
to
parties
or
do
anything
that
could
jeopardize
my
future
cornell
gave
me
freedom
to
do
as
a
please
learn
what
i
want
and
to
not
have
to
worry
if
i
was
going
to
have
food
to
eat
that
night
cornell
is
an
amazing
place
and
most
of
you
people
don't
understand
how
valuable
the
name
and
education
is
you
should
be
thanking
yourself
that
you
got
into
such
a
great
university
now
go
back
and
evaluate
your
life
how
pathetic
do
your
stupid
first
world
problems
sound
now
you're
not
fending
for
your
life
in
the
middle
east
you're
not
worrying
about
what
to
eat
at
night
you
have
heat
you
have
a
place
to
live
i
didn't
have
most
of
those
things
growing
up
and
i
never
complained
in
conclusion
grow
the
fuck
up
study
harder
get
tutoring
if
you're
behind
stop
being
a
loner
and
go
out
and
make
some
friends
it's
really
not
that
hard
you
have
it
wayyy
easier
than
you
think
dear
r
this
is
a
i
cant
believe
you
are
using
cc
confessions
to
talk
to
me
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
up
for
coffee
just
yet
can
we
get
to
know
each
other
before
we
jump
to
coffee
from
a
justice
served
so
last
night
after
being
a
good
little
wildcat
and
studying
all
night
my
drunk
roommates
come
home
with
the
munchies
and
we
all
whisk
off
to
d
hop
being
the
only
sober
person
on
main
street
is
always
entertaining
and
last
proved
to
be
no
exception
no
sooner
do
we
sit
down
in
mama
macs
to
enjoy
our
pizza
do
my
roommates
dissolve
into
laughter
about
who
even
knows
what
start
loudly
quoting
movies
and
generally
making
a
harmless
yet
loud
fools
of
them
selves
naturally
this
escalated
to
gummy
bears
being
tossed
around
and
it
was
just
about
time
to
go
so
this
shout
out
goes
to
the
bitch
behind
us
i
will
sit
there
and
listen
to
you
complain
about
how
loud
we
are
it
wasn't
thursday
night
at
midnight
or
anything
and
how
annoying
we
are
god
who
has
the
audacity
to
laugh
these
days
and
how
immature
we
are
guilty
my
roommate
had
gummy
bears
up
her
nose
but
you
mother
fucker
i
will
be
god
damned
when
you
call
them
stupid
bitches
only
after
they
walk
out
mind
you
if
you
think
i'm
not
going
to
get
pissed
but
my
real
breaking
point
you
do
not
call
my
girls
sluts
so
listen
up
first
of
all
get
over
yourself
you're
out
on
a
thursday
night
at
drunk
biddy
central
of
the
universe
stuffy
your
own
grumpy
little
face
if
you
wanted
a
quiet
dinner
get
your
drunk
munchies
elsewhere
secondly
if
you're
going
to
say
something
say
it
to
they're
face
and
not
as
they
walk
out
the
door
i'm
sorry
you're
a
pussy
grow
some
balls
third
before
you
call
someone
who
is
wearing
jeans
sperry's
and
a
sweatshirt
a
slut
maybe
you
should
adjust
your
miniskirt
and
tiny
tank
top
so
you
little
12
year
old
bits
fall
out
no
one
wants
to
see
your
pathetic
a
cups
which
brings
me
to
the
next
point
i'm
really
really
sorry
that
the
only
guy
that
wants
to
go
out
with
you
looks
like
an
anorexic
8
year
old
prep
punk
and
when
he
tell
me
that
i
should
get
my
ass
in
the
gym
yeah
i'm
going
to
be
one
rip
shit
5'2
fit
as
hell
pissed
off
blonde
oh
an
to
that
asshole
since
i
was
afraid
you
would
blow
over
the
next
time
the
wind
picked
up
i
suggest
you
shut
the
fuck
up
so
a
big
shout
out
to
all
the
girls
out
there
that
have
their
girls
backs
and
to
those
bitches
at
mama
mac's
last
night
fuck
off
re
flogdailyherald
mr
bicep
man
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
why
are
you
of
the
opinion
that
this
blog
grants
you
the
permission
to
pass
judgment
on
your
fellow
classmates
it
is
none
of
your
business
as
to
what
motivates
someone
to
work
out
and
stay
in
shape
i
doesn't
matter
if
someone
wants
to
be
healthy
lose
weight
or
impress
girls
some
people
dress
well
to
improve
their
image
some
people
get
haircuts
and
some
chose
to
live
healthy
lifestyles
there
is
no
good
reason
for
you
to
be
offended
by
someone
else's
motivation
for
being
physically
active
this
person
said
nothing
to
offend
you
and
yet
you
insist
on
spewing
your
bullcrap
as
if
you
are
entitled
to
your
superior
opinion
fuck
you
what
does
it
matter
that
he
would
like
to
impress
girls
he
sure
as
shit
isn't
trying
to
impress
you
you
jelly
bro
if
anything
this
article
has
revealed
your
own
inferiority
complex
towards
those
that
are
aspire
to
be
bigger
than
you
to
top
it
all
off
you
end
this
article
by
picking
a
fight
with
this
random
person
who
wants
to
stay
in
shape
i
truly
doubt
he
realizes
you
exist
and
i
hope
he
doesn't
waste
his
time
reading
your
insensitive
article
and
if
this
person
doesn't
find
you
and
whoops
your
ass
come
visit
the
nelson
anytime
i've
got
99
problems
you
don't
want
fuck
boy
no
man
has
the
right
to
be
an
amateur
in
the
matter
of
physical
training
it
is
a
shame
for
a
man
to
grow
old
without
seeing
the
beauty
and
strength
of
which
his
body
is
capable
socrates
am
i
the
only
one
here
who
cannot
stomach
the
thought
of
a
completely
innocent
unborn
child
paying
for
sins
that
are
not
their
own
how
can
people
say
a
fetus
is
not
a
child
at
20
weeks
a
fetus
can
feel
pain
and
can
hear
their
mothers
voice
i
understand
women
have
a
right
to
their
body
but
it's
so
completely
selfish
to
snuff
out
a
life
before
he
she
has
a
chance
to
even
live
1252
my
dads
a
doctor
nd
told
me
i
should
steer
far
away
from
the
profession
my
moms
living
off
child
custody
and
welfare
and
advises
a
profession
with
fat
paychecks
yeah
i
get
it
the
grass
is
greener
but
did
the
middle
ground
disappear
like
a
normal
human
being
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
my
education
here
but
i
can't
shake
the
thought
that
i'm
going
nowhere
i'll
just
live
it
up
i
guess
572
i
consider
myself
a
straight
woman
but
only
like
watching
lesbian
porn
chicks
have
to
look
super
girly
too
also
i
have
a
total
girl
crush
on
a
girl
here
and
have
had
this
crush
for
about
2
years
what

at
dinner
telling
their
friend
at
a
job
interview
don't
wear
anything
that
makes
you
stand
out
is
this
really
the
world

want
to
live
in
566
people
alway
say
pepperdine
has
no
school
spirit
well
maybe
if
we
weren't
called
the
waves
students
would
actually
start
showing
up
to
games
willie
the
wave
c'mon
are
you
fucking
kidding
me
i
kinda
came
to
terms
with
it
when
it
was
for
the
entire
student
population
but
"12,000"
for
a
party
for
a
quarter
of
the
school
i
understand
that
it's
a
health
hazard
but
that
is
so
fucked
up
freshmen
can't
go
abroad
because
there's
no
financial
aid
left
but
spending
"12,000"
on
a
party
for
only
500
people
is
a
better
use
of
money
i
must
be
going
insane
someone
tell
me
how
this
makes
any
sense
at
all
providence
college
is
providing
busing
for
the
students
to
td
garden
for
friday
why
the
fuck
isn't
unh
doing
that
i
have
a
boyfriend
but
i
also
have
a
huge
huge
crush
on
this
sophomore
ex
rugby
girl
and
i
don't
know
how
to
approach
her
about
it
i'm
only
a
freshman
and
i'm
intimated
by
her
and
the
intense
social
justice
conversations
we
have
had
any
man
up
dilemma
advice
the
whole
time
we
were
seeing
each
other
i
knew
you
were
bad
for
me
but
couldn't
shake
you
off
because
you
were
my
first
time
i
can't
believe
i
ignored
the
fact
that
you
ripped
my
clothing
gave
me
bruises
on
my
neck
arms
and
legs
and
barely
ever
texted
me
the
sweater
you
said
i
should
hold
onto
for
a
while
that's
getting
shredded
by
my
friends
and
i
the
moment
break
is
over
here's
hoping
the
next
girl
in
your
life
has
the
balls
to
make
it
hell
i'm
so
tired
of
mortal
men
asking
me
hey
you
wanna
cop
some
blow
like
no
the
fuck
what
are
we
in
the
neolithic
age
grow
up
and
smoke
dmt
like
a
god
ever
had
one
of
those
days
where
you
can't
do
anything
right
yeah
that's
been
me
every
day
this
semester
at
least
my
grammar
is
half
decent

what
the
fuck
is
with
walking
to
class
and
everybody
avoiding
eye
contact
like
they're
all
strung
out
on
crystal
meth
i
think
that's
super
weird
like
i'm
sure
the
song
on
your
ipod
is
super
dope
but
take
a
break
from
listening
to
levels
for
the
millionth
time

it's
not
even
about
our
genders
our
ages
what
is
sexual
orientation
but
an
invisible
fence
around
love
what
is
age
but
an
often
inaccurate
gauge
of
maturity
all
i
know
is
that
i'm
drawn
to
you
and
your
person
and
my
heart
beats
for
your
smile
you
know
kind
of
like
the
way
it
used
to
beat
for
his
except
now
i
am
neither
seventeen
nor
naive
now
i'm
just
jaded
walls
built
higher
but
even
jericho
fell
at
the
sound
of
the
right
voice
whether
you
show
your
face
or
disappear
i'll
love
where
love
can
live
i
love
you
do
you
love
me
too
do
you
despise
me
for
what
i
did
to
you
i
know
it's
you
my
love
that
wasn't
me
is
this
you
i
want
to
tell
you
i
love
you
but
you'll
tell
me
that
you
don't
love
me
and
that's
a
lie
you'll
tell
me
to
move
on
i
will
tell
you
that
i
have
moved
on
and
that's
also
a
lie
i
wish
you
could
trust
me
enough
to
be
honest

posting
about
the

indian
what
store
do
you

at
and

pass
through
or
to
the
girl
confirming

is
an
indian

i
have
a
structured
settlement
but
need
cash
now
wat
do
i
just
have
a
couple
of
questions
on
the
abortion
is
only
okay
in
cases
of
rape
incest
and
if
it
endangers
the
health
of
the
mother
opinion
we
already
know
rapists
walk
free
such
is
our
legal
system
that
is
a
whole
different
topic
if
this
type
of
abortion
law
existed
could
you
imagine
the
horror
of
a
woman
having
to
carry
her
rapist's
child
because
a
jury
judge
decided
that
it
wasn't
rape
incest
is
fairly
easy
to
prove
i
guess
but
as
far
as
endangering
the
health
of
the
mother
what
would
the
line
be
many
cases
are
different
and
should
a
woman
have
to
carry
to
term
even
if
it
means
there
is
a
very
small
chance
she
won't
make
it
also
think
about
all
the
woman
and
i
know
this
sounds
really
bad
who
will
take
advantage
of
this
and
cry
rape
even
if
it
was
100
consensual
to
try
and
get
an
abortion
maybe
the
that
last
statement
about
crying
rape
is
not
a
good
argument
but
regardless
i
think
it's
a
good
idea
in
theory
but
that
it
could
never
work
one
thing
i
love
about
college
the
fact
that
swagfags
ghetto
people
and
scene
kids
are
non
existent
here
on
campus
unlike
my
high
school
in
which
those
little
shits
were
basically
an
epidemic
i'm
a
virgin
just
got
into
a
very
heated
relationship
and
i
have
a
very
serious
question
to
ask
i've
noticed
my
ear
holes
are
too
small
to
fit
q
tips
in
does
this
mean
my
vagina
will
be
way
to
small
to
fit
a
penis
in
1953
definitely
an
engineer
i'm
a
computer
science
major
and
i
had
the
opportunity
to
do
anal
and
i
turned
it
down
who
said
engineers
can't
get
laid
17787
i
wish
gay
girls
at
lgbt
parties
were
more
approachable
either
that
or
they
approached
me
do
i
really
seem
that
straight
someone
tell
me
why
half
the
stands
were
empty
near
the
end
of
the
fourth
we
can
see
that
on
tv
you
2
ters
i
live
out
of
town
and
shouldn't
have
to
see
half
the
student
section
empty
we
won
stay
and
enjoy
for
heaven's
sake
135
if
you
could
have
a
superpower
what
would
it
be
mine
would
be
superstrength
because
as
an
american
i
think
being
very
strong
is
important
for
lifting
thing
and
then
putting
it
down
later
also
i
can
be
the
coolest
guy
at
the
gym
girls
will
also
be
very
impressed
by
my
ability
to
move
different
things
and
i
think
that
is
important
too
at
least
in
the
long
run
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
just
like
rub
an
ointment
on
my
arms
to
make
the
grow
to
be
superstrong
but
i
usually
just
sit
around
thinking
about
the
ointment
instead
of
doing
the
actual
ointment
upon
arm
rubbing
anyone
know
where
all
the
mormons
hang
out
here
in
davis
i
want
to
show
them
the
true
gospel
of
salvation
and
him
crucified

back
home
i
devil
stick
spin
poi
make
jewelry
jam
out
and
get
stoned
as
a
boulder
i
believe
that
astrology
has
significance
and
talk
about
shit
that
most
people
here
never
care
to
listen
to
i
believe
knowing
someone's
vibes
aura
and
spirit
are
more
important
than
what
major
they
are
or
how
classes
are
going
i
use
drugs
to
understand
nature
and
life
but
here
i
get
judged
for
just
toking
one
here
it
always
amazes
me
how
people
drive
themselves
insane
learning
what's
on
the
prelim
yet
don't
take
two
seconds
to
stop
and
think
about
the
intricacies
of
our
universe
they
marvel
at
the
wonders
of
scientist
and
philosophers
of
the
past
whilst
shaming
and
ridiculing
using
emotional
and
psychedelic
experiences
as
a
method
for
discovery
believing
in
and
reassuring
our
culture's
stigma
against
substances
that
cause
one
to
question
the
very
essence
of
being
accepting
these
rules
as
good
choices
because
self
discovery
would
be
too
risky
back
home
i
have
deeper
conversations
than
any
i've
heard
here
i
grow
as
a
person
from
my
daily
interactions
with
the
people
around
me
here
i
waste
away
studying
beating
the
mean
and
being
closed
out
by
people
who
are
too
busy
to
take
a
trip
outside
their
comfort
zones
and
expand
their
way
of
thinking
when
did
you
all
forsake
yourselves

fanominal

myself
in
the
mood

this
normal

it
with
guys
here
and
short
girls
seems
these
days
every
time

same
way

cuter
shorter

be
frank
i'm
pretty

been
told

lot
and
i
literally
couldn't
care
less
about
a
guy's
height

what
happened
to
the
third
admin
the
really
annoying
one
where
did
he
go
o_0
he
hasn't
posted
anything
lately
why
the
fuck
are
the
people
here
so
tall
real
talk
regarding
the
whole
fish
camp
photos
people
make
mistakes
it
was
clearly
a
mistake
i
am
quite
positive
the
camp
was
not
intending
to
be
disrespectful
who
would
do
that
i
am
looking
at
everyone's
post
only
to
find
a
bunch
of
rude
comments
condemning
fish
camp
everyone's
acting
as
if
they
have
never
made
a
mistake
as
if
they
are
a
perfect
aggie
you
aren't
neither
am
i
i
see
things
like
they
should
apologize
they
are
terrible
what
a
horrible
organization
duh
they
should
apologize
and
they
are
it
was
a
camp
of
20
something
counselors
out
of
1000
some
odd
people
why
would
we
want
to
take
the
whole
dang
organization
down
fish
camp
does
alot
of
great
things
when
i
went
i
really
received
a
fire
of
aggie
spirit
from
the
experience
i
also
learned
about
my
school
and
its
amazing
traditions
i
wasn't
even
one
if
the
people
all
into
it
please
stop
with
the
rude
remarks
it
just
makes
the
fire
bigger
it
doesn't
solve
anything
it
makes
it
a
heck
of
alot
worse
i've
seen
so
many
mean
comments
about
people
and
the
organization
if
you
have
nothing
nice
to
say
then
don't
say
it
nobody
is
perfect
ever
we
got
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
help
eachother
along
the
way
one
of
the
core
values
is
respect
we
have
to
respect
eachother
as
well
so
i
meet
this
girl
on
sunday
and
ask
for
her
number
i'm
out
of
town
so
we
haven't
been
able
to
hang
out
but
we've
certainly
talked
a
lot
she's
back
in
her
home
town
today
which
is
actually
really
close
to
where
i
will
be
until
tomorrow
so
i
asked
her
monday
if
she'd
be
free
to
go
out
for
dinner
and
a
movie
we'd
talked
about
her
wanting
to
see
gatsby
and
she
said
she'd
let
me
know
amidst
us
talking
today
i
asked
her
what
her
plans
were
for
tonight
and
she
said
she's
seeing
gatsby
with
a
friend
really
does
she
have
any
idea
that
i've
been
looking
forward
to
tonight
who
the
fuck
is
actually
going
to
stop
drinking
hard
liquor
when
they
ban
it
what
is
the
difference
between
s.m.a.r.t
and
the
other
blue
party
when
running
for
senate
or
president

i
don't
really
have
any
friends
at
cornell
and
my
time
here
has
been
kind
of
miserable
because
of
it
i
don't
know
where
to
go
or
who
to
talk
to
and
i
generally
haven't
been
able
to
open
up
but
now
that
i
have
gotten
close
to
a
couple
people
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do
when
i
can't
hang
out
with
them
or
see
them
because
i
know
they
lead
active
social
lives
unlike
me
add
that
to
the
fact
that
i'm
in
a
long
distance
relationship
and
that
i
avoid
contact
with
the
opposite
sex
and
i
am
one
lonely
motherfucker
i
regret
it
and
i
want
to
change
how
do
i
meet
people
who
aren't
going
to
close
themselves
off
to
me
since
they're
already
too
comfortable
to
let
me
be
a
part
of
their
lives
some
days
i
would
just
like
to
lose
my
virginity
to
a
random
hot
stranger
just
to
get
it
over
with
then
my
conscious
kicks
in
and
tells
me
to
wait
until
i'm
ready
with
the
right
guy
what
do
i
do
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
my
boyfriend's
ex
didn't
get
into
madison
but
i
did
automatically
makes
me
better
than
her
conceited
maybe
i
know
bonfire
people
really
like
dixie
chicken
but
do
they
know
where
the
name
comes
from
i
was
surprised
when
i
read
about
the
dixiecrat
party
do
some
research
so
update
3
the
cat's
out
of
the
bag
someone
couldn't
keep
their
big
whore
mouth
shut
jk
girl
but
seriously
you
are
the
last
person
i'm
telling
my
life
stories
to
now
so
the
handful
of
people
in
my
major
that
i
hang
with
all
know
now
and
i'm
writing
the
rest
of
this
update
with
the
assumption
they're
going
to
see
it
this
is
also
probably
my
last
update
on
this
topic
at
least
you
might
see
more
of
me
in
the
future
i
have
not
heard
that
anyone
has
told
him
about
these
confessions
nor
has
he
mentioned
it
to
any
of
those
guys
we
are
mutual
friends
with
so
i
assume
either
he
hasn't
seen
it
or
he's
too
fucking
vain
to
think
that
any
girl
wouldn't
be
interested
in
him
so
let
me
spill
all
the
little
deets
i
left
out
before
just
so
this
twat
can't
possibly
mistake
this
for
someone
else
telling
me
you've
got
old
material
from
this
course
that
you'll
email
it
to
me
if
i
text
you
my
email
address
is
hands
down
the
lamest
way
to
score
my
digits
it
didn't
fool
me
but
i
really
wanted
those
old
homeworks
because
that
shit
takes
forever
asking
me
what
my
father
does
just
to
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
about
your
dad
is
fucking
weird
like
i
get
now
that
you
clearly
have
some
serious
daddy
issues
it
doesn't
impress
me
that
your
father
is
some
hot
shot
lawyer
from
some
podunk
town
in
the
middle
of
buttfuck
nowhere
texas
i
really
don't
get
where
you
were
going
with
that
you
car
is
ugly
every
fucking
daddy's
boy
has
a
souped
up
mustang
the
fact
that
you
clearly
expected
such
a
sweet
ride
to
impress
me
to
the
point
that
you
were
showing
me
pics
on
your
phone
is
gay
what
was
i
supposed
to
say
like
omg
your
car
is
soooooo
cool
your
dick
must
be
huge
i
mean
really
come
on
bro
lifted
truck
or
gtfo
if
you
actually
thought
paying
for
my
meal
was
going
to
get
you
in
my
pants
you're
sorely
mistaken
after
all
that
shit
you
pulled
during
the
meal
no
girl
is
ever
going
to
mistake
you
for
a
gentleman
not
to
mention
i
ordered
one
of
the
cheapest
things
on
the
menu
i
don't
think
even
a
back
alley
crack
whore
is
going
to
put
out
for
7.99
plus
tax
and
tip
speaking
of
tip
who
the
fuck
leaves
that
little
i've
never
been
a
waiter
but
i
know
how
hard
it
is
to
do
what
they
do
and
i
never
leave
less
than
15
you
left
barely
a
dollar
on
a
20
dollar
meal
you're
a
fucking
cunt
a
huge
goddamn
thundercunt
you
are
so
functionally
retarded
on
every
level
i'm
shocked
you've
managed
to
make
it
this
far
without
getting
shanked
by
someone
i
mean
really
i
get
that
boys
have
their
little
bro
chats
but
that
talk
should
never
ever
ever
make
it
back
to
the
girl
in
question
don't
get
me
wrong
i'm
flattered
that
a
rather
large
group
of
males
my
age
thinks
i
have
a
great
set
of
tits
ain't
nothing
wrong
with
that
tits
are
great
it's
not
like
you
can
motorboat
a
personality
but
the
fact
that
you
a
guy
who
attempted
to
have
some
kind
of
relationship
with
me
brought
this
up
in
front
of
them
is
creepy
as
fuck
that
and
the
fact
that
at
least
a
few
of
these
people
liked
me
way
more
than
they
liked
you
and
came
and
told
me
all
about
this
nobody
wants
a
dude
that
kisses
and
tells
or
in
your
case
misses
and
tells
and
finally
dude
get
over
it
you
had
your
chance
and
you
fucked
up
you
done
fucked
up
big
you're
not
going
to
get
a
second
chance
so
stop
trying
to
talk
to
me
stop
sitting
behind
me
in
class
i
can
feel
your
creepy
little
caca
brown
eyes
on
me
you're
trippin
if
you
think
those
are
hazel
brah
and
stop
telling
people
we're
cool
we're
not
cool
we're
never
gonna
be
cool
i'm
serious
about
this
being
my
last
update
i
don't
foresee
this
getting
beyond
petty
little
gossip
behind
my
back
and
being
a
creeper
boys
are
stupid
and
some
are
weird
as
fuck
either
he's
going
to
figure
that
out
or
not
and
either
way
it's
pointless
for
me
to
harp
over
every
stupid
thing
he
does
it's
a
total
waste
of
my
fucking
time
i've
go
2958
i'm
so
sick
of
students
taking
adderall
when
they
do
not
have
a
prescription
it's
not
fair
how
can
someone
live
with
themselves
and
feel
accomplished
by
cheating
300
to
the
smokin
girl
in
my
11am
biology
class
wanna
make
out
i
am
a
texan
country
girl
here
at
tamu
and
i'm
having
the
hardest
time
finding
a
country
man
im
lost
in
a
sea
of
city
boys
country
boys
where
are
you
this
southern
girl
is
lonely
18355
i'm
a
relatively
outstanding
vocalist
i
miss
performing
solo
so
much
what
to
do
15480
i
feel
as
though
i've
drifted
from
the
friends
i've
made
here
in
the
past
2
years
what
are
some
great
orgs
clubs
i
can
join
to
meet
new
people

tour
guides
need
to
stop
telling
prospective
students
if
they
will
or
won't
fit
in
at
lafayette
just
because
you
think
there
isn't
a
specific
group
here
at
this
college
that
the
prospie
would
fit
into
doesn't
mean
it's
not
here
and
who
are
you
to
judge
a
person
based
on
their
appearance
and
decide
that
they
fit
into
a
specific
group
stop
ruining
our
chances
of
getting
a
more
diverse
population
of
students
by
weeding
out
the
weird
ones
who
you
think
won't
fit
in
tour
guides
it's
your
job
to
show
the
prospies
how
amazing
lafayette
is
and
then
let
them
decide
the
rest
what
do
y'all
think
of
the
new
campus
being
set
up
at
israel
the
peeps
at
qatar
don't
seem
to
like
it
why
are
rice
guys
so
cute
especially
the
asian
ones
ladies
when
you
don't
want
to
hang
out
or
go
out
with
a
guy
even
though
he's
trying
for
the
love
of
god
just
say
no
i
feel
like
i'm
wasting
my
life
just
waiting
for
you
to
say
no
anyways
why
drag
us
along
alright
who's
21
i'm
sorry
for
posting
when
i
don't
even
go
here
just
wondering
if
any
of
you
all
got
in
after
being
wait
listed
i'm
pretty
crushed
and
i
would
accept
an
offer
in
a
heartbeat
NA
NA
NA
NA
why
does
every
man
want
anal
i
have
a
vagina
and
a
mouth
use
both
regularly
and
yet
men
just
want
that
i
think
they
are
all
secretly
bi
who
else
wants
to
start
a
marijuana
legalization
club
we
can
just
sit
around
and
talk
about
how
awesome
weed
is
stoned
as
shit
of
course
would
you
rather
suck
a
dick
for
a
hour
and
receive
3
million
dollars
or
have
sex
with
a
girl
and
pay
her
1000
dollars
i'm
getting
tired
of
all
of
these
confessions
about
giving
up
a
seat
on
the
bus
for
someone
why
you
may
ask
well
let
me
get
fucking
started
if
you
offer
up
you
seat
to
a
lady
as
a
guy
you
will
either
a
be
giving
a
sly
wtf
is
wrong
with
you
i
am
a
proud
strong
woman
who
dont
need
no
mans
seat
or
b
a
forced
thank
you
or
even
worse
no
gratification
whatsoever
and
the
body
language
of
someone
whom
is
being
forced
into
seating
of
course
there
are
always
those
people
whom
are
genuinely
grateful
but
eh
too
few
to
take
into
account
my
advice
to
all
of
you
whether
small
girl
or
just
lack
proper
manners
is
to
plan
ahead
when
i
was
taking
the
bus
i
would
get
ready
to
catch
the
bus
before
the
one
i
actually
needed
to
get
on
in
case
it
was
too
full
if
your
small
and
or
want
to
catch
a
seat
try
to
beat
everyone
there
and
if
your
route
crosses
the
same
street
twice
in
one
loop
then
get
on
the
side
that
it
crosses
first
not
too
hard
ags
not
too
hard

what
does
it
mean
when
a
guy
stops
you
and
kisses
you
as
you
leave
on
behalf
of
all
men
i
want
to
make
a
sincere
apology
to
all
women
who
have
been
neglected
abused
mistreated
cheated
and
disrespected
in
relationships
also
i
am
speaking
to
the
women
who
just
can't
seem
to
find
the
right
guy
i
have
been
speaking
with
women
who
are
in
these
relationships
so
i
dedicate
this
to
you
all
for
being
so
strong
when
you
don't
even
know
that
you
are
relationships
should
be
a
comfort
zone
not
where
you
feel
uneasy
so
please
accept
this
apology
and
know
that
things
will
get
better

watch
v
kh4rgok86tq
from
a
gay
guy
to
a
straight
a
guy
as
a
disclaimer
i
want
to
first
say
that
i
don't
think
every
interaction
i
have
with
a
guy
is
him
flirting
or
him
being
interested
on
the
contrary
probably
all
of
my
friends
are
straight
actually
anyway
honest
question
here
i
am
curious
as
to
how
offended
would
some
of
you
be
if
you
happened
to
meet
a
new
bud
and
after
a
while
he
asked
you
to
lunch
dinner
i'm
not
outwardly
gay
but
i
don't
believe
it's
something
that
needs
to
be
announced
and
it
makes
me
hesitant
to
try
to
date
anyone
because
it's
sometimes
difficult
to
tell
if
a
guy
might
just
be
straight
and
being
friendly
or
if
he
is
also
possibly
interested
too
there's
rare
occasions
with
blurred
lines
and
i
don't
want
to
miss
any
opportunities
anymore
the
song
of
the

today
was
the
first
time
i
got
to
see
the
shitty
part
of
new
york
i
dropped
my
friend
at
2nd
street
and
stood
next
to
the
traffic
pole
a
few
yards
away
to
cross
the
street
when
a
large
bottle
full
of
some
white
liquid
exploded
at
the
base
of
the
pole
right
next
to
my
feet
i
didn't
know
how
to
react
i
just
turned
around
and
some
drunk
man
standing
outside
the
bar
was
staring
at
me
mumbling
yelling
i
wanna
talk
to
you
it
was
in
public
and
there
were
two
people
with
him
also
staring
at
me
but
apparently
i
that
was
a
common
ritual
of
introduction
for
drunks
on
bowery
i
stopped
looking
at
him
because
i
think
it
was
making
him
want
to
approach
me
and
when
the
light
finally
turned
green
i
walked
away
also
and
this
makes
me
feel
like
garbage
i
saw
a
piece
of
shit
on
his
phone
forcibly
dragging
his
senile
dachshund
whose
fur
is
patched
and
gray
by
the
neck
dog
is
audibly
choking
cause
it
can't
walk
that
fast
no
one
around
me
stopped
to
pay
any
heed
and
i
didn't
stop
him
because
i
didn't
want
to
piss
the
guy
off
and
have
him
take
out
that
anger
on
the
animal
he
so
obviously
abuses
on
a
daily
basis
beyond
calling
the
police
or
taking
the
animal
away
from
the
guy
i
didn't
know
how
to
help
and
i
can't
imagine
the
man
would've
been
penalized
if
i
had
called
any
authorities
should
i
have
taken
a
video
of
the
dog
to
show
them
would
they
have
believed
me
i
felt
completely
unable
to
help
the
bugger
so
i
feel
like
a
shitbag
who
is
also
afraid
to
walk
the
streets
these
men
by
the
way
were
unintimidating
prior
to
suggesting
assault
average
looking
not
homeless
and
not
apparently
crazy
on
busy
streets
full
of
witnesses
that
terrified
me
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
fact
that
i'm
tall
male
white
and
pretty
unattractive
meant
people
wouldn't
screw
with
me
but
now
i'm
thankful
i
haven't
been
assaulted
happy
thanksgiving
14144
i
know
that
a
lot
of
girls
find
drive
ambition
in
a
guy
sexy
but
somehow
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
any
girl
would
find
it
sexy
that
i
already
studying
for
my
classes
in
the
fall
semester
so
that
i
will
get
great
grades
which
will
hopefully
lead
to
a
great
job
and
a
great
graduate
school
where's
the
cutoff
between
ambition
being
sexy
and
ambition
being
nerdy
17021
in
response
to
all
these
posts
i
see
saying
basically
where
are
the
guys
who
just
want
relationships
and
not
hookups
we
exist
i
swear
some
of
us
really
want
relationships
too
but
it's
tough
when
the
only
people
i've
attracted
since
coming
to
college
have
turned
out
to
be
psychotic
or
moved
away
from
cornell
before
a
move
could
be
made
or
have
some
ties
to
friends
that
make
dating
them
violate
bro
code
and
the
only
women
i
would
date
in
good
conscience
would
rather
remain
single
or
are
taken
or
something
of
the
sort
i
know
there
are
great
women
out
there
lots
of
fish
in
the
sea
as
it
were
but
it's
tough
to
meet
them
when
you're
more
than
halfway
through
college
and
significantly
into
the
semester
now
is
a
tough
time
to
join
new
clubs
social
circles
etc
to
meet
new
people
since
cliques
and
the
sort
are
already
established
and
it'll
only
get
tougher
as
junior
year
turns
into
the
dreaded
senior
year
when
new
relationships
are
almost
out
the
window
for
what
it's
worth
there
are
guys
for
whom
this
struggle
is
really
frustrating
as
well
advice
to
a
freshman
with
little
academic
motivation
and
scholarship
s
that
are
significant
and
require
a
3.5
gpa
or
above
who
has
already
basically
screwed
his
first
semester
major
biomedical
science
going
to
complete
2
4
of
my
classes
with
a
2.9
gpa
most
likely
but
a
2.0
if
i
continue
to
be
a
lazy
ass
sometimes
i
feel
like
i
totally
said
the
wrong
thing
and
wonder
how
i
can
get
to
hang
out
with
other
people
and
do
all
the
fun
stuff
they
seem
to
have
it
wouldn't
be
so
bad
except
at
least
in
high
school
you
knew
everyone
was
an
ass
here
almost
everyone's
cool
which
makes
the
prospect
of
failing
socially
even
more
terrifying
are
sororities
and
fraternities
really
that
expensive
that
people
make
fun
of
them
about
buying
friends
don't
all
clubs
have
membership
fees
anyways
so
what's
the
difference
serious
question
stupid
t
mobile
commercial
so
jeremy's
parents
leave
a
videomail
instead
of
voicemail
to
stop
him
from
using
his
phone
outside
of
u.s
when
he
sees
all
these
videos
their
fee
will
get
higher
and
why
not
just
drop
him
from
the
plan
for
a
while
well
good
idea
for
a
commercial
though
is
engaged
he's
only
being
dating
that
broad
for
like
6
months
if
that
daayyuumm
he
must
have
some
mad
swag
in
the
bedroom
to
put
a
ring
on
it
that
quick
like
the
d
must
be
good
enough
for
her
to
decide
to
quickly
she
wants
it
for
the
rest
of
her
life
haha
anyways
congrats
bro
since
coming
to
college
and
started
working
out
and
getting
ripped
it
seems
like
i'm
losing
all
interest
in
girls
and
starting
to
get
turned
on
by
other
ripped
guys
with
muscles
does
it
mean
i'm
turning
gay
or
i'm
just
envious
of
their
body
i
am
plotting
a
heist
to
steal
all
the
nerf
guns
in
the
land
who
wishes
to
join
me
i
am
an
incoming
transfer
student
living
off
campus
and
want
to
get
involved
but
don't
really
know
anyone
or
how
to
get
into
anything
i
don't
want
to
be
that
weird
girl
that
sits
alone
at
everything
any
advice
to
me
honestly
a
little
upset
about
the
amount
of
gilrs
wearing
burkas
on
campus
i
know
its
for
religious
reasons
but
this
isn't
saudi
arabia
or
some
other
middle
eastern
hell
hole
they
shouldn't
have
to
wear
that
france
banned
burkas
how
the
hell
are
we
less
conservative
than
france
ok
so
i
ride
bus
26
on
a
regular
basis
i've
noticed
this
a
lot
and
i
don't
mean
to
sound
racist
by
asking
this
but
why
are
there
so
many
asians
that
ride
it
it's
even
weirder
when
i
stay
on
campus
late
and
there
are
more
asians
riding
the
11
15
pm
bus
than
at
any
other
point
of
the
day
about
90
of
that
bus
is
asians
at
that
time
and
at
no
matter
what
time
of
day
they
usually
all
get
off
at
the
spot
i
gotta
ask
but
is
there
a
reason
for
this
do
they
all
work
in
the
same
major
area
whatever
is
there
some
secret
community
for
only
asians
i
need
answers
people
2196
me
and
people
from
my
class
still
have
not
received
our
grades
how
is
this
acceptable
i'd
prefer
it
if
we
didn't
really
talk
anymore
it's
tough
enough
being
in
a
class
with
you
but
do
you
really
have
to
show
up
to
my
door
no
i
don't
wanna
go
out
with
you
no
i
don't
wanna
go
on
your
silly
adventures
i'm
perfectly
content
staying
in
goofing
off
practicing
my
french
etc
please
leave
me
alone
your
mother
was
a
hamster
and
your
father
smelt
of
elderberries
ladies
ladies
your
troubles
have
ended
a
las
the
cure
suffer
from
uti's
on
a
pretty
regular
basis
hate
antibiotics
because
they
are
terrible
and
don't
let
you
have
fun
well
the
answer
is
simple
it's
called
d
mannose
haven't
heard
of
it
really
it's
simple
it
is
the
concentrated
form
of
the
active
ingredient
in
wait
for
it
cranberries
except
this
actually
cures
it
doesn't
just
treat
the
symptoms
it's
a
miracle
omg
i
sound
like
a
spam
ad
where
you
ask
where
can
can
you
find
it
the
answer
your
nearest
whole
foods
for
only
20
and
it's
totally
organic
and
natural
and
vegetarian
and
ahhh
it
feels
so
good
to
pee
warning
do
not
even
try
to
reply
to
this
with
some
condescending
medical
comment
you
know
nothing
jon
snow
to
cheryl
from
archer
can
i
just
call
you
cheryl
from
like
minded
confessor
i
agree
it's
good
to
be
reminded
sometimes
that
it's
not
a
bad
thing
because
it
can
feel
wrong
even
when
it's
consensual
side
note
i
know
way
too
many
friends
with
handcuffs
here
15477
so
i
don't
know
how
many
are
trolls
but
there
are
a
lot
of
posts
about
wanting
to
bag
a
black
guy
i'm
not
sure
whether
to
feel
respected
or
insulted
that
no
one
on
this
board
and
seemingly
on
campus
is
desirous
of
black
women
can
we
get
some
love
lust
cordially
objectify
please
i
just
ate
some
hummus
that
was
2.5
months
expired
should
i
worry
i
wanna
date
a
nice
guy
here
who's
also
passionate
about
animals
and
will
respect
me
long
shot
yeah
i
know
where
i
am
but
are
there
any
vegetarian
guys
as
a
jock
who
pretends
to
be
all
tough
i
miss
cuddling
and
romantic
stuff
why
does
everyone
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
5181
many
years
after
graduating
i'm
heading
back
to
nyu
for
graduate
school
i'm
terrified
to
see
how
things
have
changed
my
first
big
change
nyu
doesn't
send
paper
acceptance
letters
any
more
that
takes
out
half
the
joy
out
of
being
accepted
radio
and
krystal
y
u
no
facebook
official
i
am
in
love
with
one
of
you
and
this
not
being
fbo
shit
is
throwing
me
off
do
i
make
a
move
or
not
4956
4914
and
others
all
of
a
sudden
people
are
so
helpful
with
everyone's
individual
problems
unfortunately
distanced
and
made
unapproachable
by
this
anonymity
on
a
different
note
where
can
you
meet
social
people
that
like
to
go
out
but
aren't
necessarily
greek
can't
imagine
being
the
only
one
with
this
problem
are
there
any
hot
girly
girl
lesbians
at
cc
i'm
a
girl
looking
for
a
girlie
girl
not
losing
hope
my
confession
is
that
as
much
as
i
love
my
roommate
it's
getting
old
annoying
and
i
need
my
goddamn
space
i
cant
be
mean
but
can
no
one
take
a
hint
is
it
bad
that
i
use
tinder
but
currently
in
a
relationship
okay
we
are
going
to
briefly
pause
and
let
you
focus
on
finals
it's
crunch
time
now
the
hour
is
almost
at
hand
you
can
feel
the
pressure
getting
to
you
you
don't
want
to
sleep
you
don't
want
to
eat
anymore
you
feel
tired
and
afraid
at
the
same
time
in
other
words
conditions
are
perfect
why
because
this
is
when
success
happens
success
is
not
going
to
be
rolled
out
to
you
on
a
red
carpet
you
have
to
take
it
cling
to
it
and
run
with
it
and
never
look
back
maybe
you
weren't
the
best
student
this
semester
maybe
you
goofed
off
when
you
should
have
studied
maybe
you
haven't
used
your
time
wisely
maybe
you
have
broken
promise
after
promise
to
yourself
dont
let
disappointment
hold
you
back
today
is
a
new
day
yesterday
doesn't
matter
anymore
all
you
have
is
this
moment
forget
who
you
were
yesterday
and
be
a
great
student
today
work
extremely
hard
today
focus
today
seize
the
moment
today
and
you
will
be
ready
to
face
tomorrow
you
can
have
what
you
want
but
you
have
to
destroy
your
dreams
and
replace
them
with
goals
what's
the
difference
a
goal
has
all
the
optimism
and
hope
of
a
dream
but
it
also
has
preparation
and
planning
and
pain
a
goal
is
pragmatic
a
dream
is
idealistic
a
dream
can't
be
reached
a
goal
is
meant
to
achieved
and
built
on
set
a
small
goal
for
yourself
maybe
it's
to
study
for
thirty
minutes
without
checking
your
facebook
achieve
it
reward
yourself
then
set
another
rinse
and
repeat
you
are
on
the
road
to
success
that's
all
greatness
is
as
one
hall
of
famer
once
said
greatness
is
not
some
big
unattainable
thing
it's
many
small
things
done
well
day
after
day
work
out
after
work
out
with
discipline
and
obedience
day
after
day
this
is
your
time
raise
that
grade
from
a
b
to
an
a
or
a
c
to
a
b
graduate
with
honors
save
your
gpa
you
can
do
it
if
a
human
being
can
walk
on
the
moon
or
become
a
billionaire
or
run
a
100
meters
in
under
10
seconds
or
unlock
the
secrets
of
the
universe
from
a
wheelchair
there
is
no
damn
reason
you
cannot
achieve
your
goals
at
this
page
we
strive
to
entertain
you
not
impede
you
we
dont
want
to
be
a
distraction
so
we
will
briefly
step
aside
the
way
is
now
cleared
the
road
is
open
go
get
it
coach
said
dominate
and
thats
exactly
what
were
gonna
do
to
em
aggies
admins
has
anybody
ever
went
to
beutel
just
to
get
an
excused
absence
note
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
take
a
test
didn't
feel
like
going
to
class
etc
i
confess
i've
done
it
once
or
twice
before
i
feel
so
awful
and
ashamed
about
it
to
this
day
so
i
have
a
boyfriend
who
is
a
senior
in
the
corps
he's
graduating
and
going
to
do
the
air
force
when
he
graduates
i
on
the
other
hand
have
med
school
so
i'm
staying
here
has
anyone
done
the
whole
army
girlfriend
thing
holla
at
yo
gurl
with
some
advice
i
feel
like
any
school
besides
a
m
and
t.u
are
backup
schools
don't
like
what
i
have
to
say
what
was
your
backup
school
3358
so
does
that
mean
that
eric
is
single
i've
had
the
biggest
crush
on
him
since
we
met
last
semester
it's
too
bad
he
only
sees
me
as
a
friend
he's
also
sort
of
a
player
so
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
he
was
already
seeing
someone
1956
is
it
ever
too
late
4278
i
legitimately
don't
understand
why
there
is
a
debate
over
diversity
right
now
nyu
is
more
diverse
than
many
other
universities
and
quite
frankly
i
think
that
being
accepted
to
this
institution
has
more
to
do
with
qualifications
than
ethnic
background
if
you
are
so
concerned
about
the
diversity
of
nyu
and
it
bothers
you
that
much
then
you
probably
should
have
gone
to
a
different
university
and
furthermore
why
are
we
making
race
into
such
a
large
issue
we
are
all
people
and
it
shouldn't
matter
what
someone's
skin
color
is
seriously
i
don't
understand
you
chose
to
come
here
either
stop
complaining
or
transfer
do
people
realize
that
whenever
a
liberal
makes
an
argument
it's
supported
with
actual
facts
instead
of
an
opinion
lol
conservatives
like
to
talk
shit
about
obama
because
he
supposedly
wanted
to
take
away
guns
blah
blah
blah
ronald
fucking
reagan
limited
gun
rights
because
even
he
knew
people
can't
just
walk
around
with
guns
hanging
out
and
also
to
the
first
right
wing
retard
who
comments
on
this
lol
ahead
of
time
to
what
you're
going
to
say
about
your
political
opinion
long
live
obama
hillary
2016
that's
all
mother
fuckers
i
cringe
whenever
a
woman
says
she
doesn't
like
feminists
or
she
thinks
they're
annoying
etc
why
would
anyone
particularly
a
woman
not
be
a
feminist
do
you
not
want
to
be
equal
a
lot
of
you
obviously
do
not
know
what
feminism
is
read
a
damn
book
and
stop
making
us
as
a
gender
look
dumb
i'm
an
aggie
and
i
love
my
school
but
why
do
people
continue
to
proclaim
that
a
m
is
the
best
university
in
the
nation
do
they
actually
believe
this
or
is
it
just
to
make
freshmen
feel
important
we're
not
1
in
academics
overall
and
we're
not
the
only
school
that
has
traditions
while
the
harvard
network
may
be
smaller
i'm
sure
it
is
more
powerful
save
the
strength
in
numbers
argument
i'm
talking
about
the
power
to
change
things
make
them
happen
544
to
all
hoyas
who
are
looking
for
someone
to
love
make
sure
you
love
yourself
first
i
wish
i
could
say
this
to
more
of
my
friends
if
you
validate
your
existence
through
others
approval
and
not
your
own
what
does
that
say
about
you
i'm
making
a
list
of
the
boys
i
wanna
sleep
with
next
year
does
that
make
me
the
freshman
whore
6436
i
think
it's
a
little
ridiculous
that
we
can't
use
our
own
calculators
for
exams
i
can
understand
it
sort
of
for
math
but
for
some
of
these
other
classes
where
we
have
to
plug
in
obscure
numbers
for
one
exam
we
couldn't
use
our
own
calculators
no
matter
what
kind
they
were
and
had
to
use
these
shitty
calculators
that
they
gave
us
really
i'm
no
calculator
extraordinaire
but
i'm
pretty
sure
i
can't
jam
all
there
is
to
know
about
chemistry
and
physics
onto
a
ti
83
it
also
puts
me
at
a
huge
disadvantage
because
i
am
absolutely
terrible
at
mental
math

with
you

can
everyone
just
stop
fucking
calling
beyonce
flawless
for
two
seconds
she's
not
flawless
she's
just
been
catapulted
into
a
place
so
heavily
worshipped
that
everyone
thinks
she's
beyond
criticism
but
that's
just
wrong
the
album
isn't
perfect
she
isn't
perfect
but
i
don't
think
any
of
you
will
stop
to
pull
her
dick
out
of
your
mouths
to
actually
acknowledge
that
i'm
just
so
sick
of
all
the
beyonce's
perfect
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
how
does
she
do
it
nonsense
that
goes
on
at
this
school
you
guys
are
part
of
the
reason
why
celebrity
worship
is
so
awful
she's
just
a
human
being
like
everyone
else
does
anybody
know
what
time
marquette's
final
four
game
is
at

why
does
no
one
here
like
mma
or
ufc
as
much
as
i
do
p.s
i
am
female

i
don't
usually
go
for
the
surfer
boys
but
you're
gorgeous
you're
also
the
star
of
the
baseball
team
and
always
have
plenty
of
brbs
you
bought
me
a
smoothie
once
but
i
doubt
you
remember
and
me
i'm
your
future
wife
what
happened
my
life
is
empty
without
these
confessions
if
the
whole
world
was
blind
how
many
people
would
you
impress

anyone
where
is
the
single
people's
club
i
honestly
think
those
of
you
that
sleep
with
multiple
people
are
complete
whores
whatever
happened
to
saving
yourself
for
someone
special
nobody
told
you
to
try
them
all
sex
is
meaningful
when
shared
with
only
one
person
those
of
you
that
play
the
number
game
and
let
multiple
people
inside
you
are
sluts
don't
even
try
to
fight
it
you
guys
girls
have
no
respect
for
yourselves
but
have
fun
with
your
diseases
and
emotionless
love
the
day
the
bombing
in
boston
occurred
i
felt
not
for
the
families
but
intense
rage
towards
those
who
had
done
it
i
took
complete
satisfaction
in
knowing
their
was
an
unstoppable
chain
of
events
we
would
never
know
about
which
would
end
in
those
people's
demise
does
that
make
me
insensitive
oh
why
do
you
look
so
sad
tears
are
in
your
eyes
3971
a
few
days
ago
you
got
germs'd
because
my
roommate
found
you
passed
out
in
a
pool
of
your
own
vomit
outside
your
door
i
understand
it
may
have
taken
you
a
day
or
so
to
recover
and
trust
me
i've
been
sloppybut
do
us
all
a
fucking
favor
and
clean
up
the
mess
you
left
on
the
landing
it's
a
truly
disgusting
testament
to
your
inconsiderate
laziness
that
you
can't
be
bothered
to
wipe
it
up
and
it's
stinking
up
the
entire
stairwell
it's
finals
the
last
thing
i
need
is
to
be
constantly
side
stepping
lake
of
solidifying
regurgitation
ps
what
did
you
even
eat
drink
that
night
black
is
a
weird
color
for
barf
i
don't
understand
it's
not
often
that
i
run
into
this
particular
situation
but
it
does
occur
occasionally
to
preface
the
situation
i
was
out
with
some
friends
at
ng
this
past
weekend
we
along
with
many
other
guys
would
generally
prefer
to
talk
to
cute
girls
while
we're
there
typically
start
as
a
fun
casual
conversation
and
if
it
advances
from
there
then
that
is
great
if
not
it
is
ok
we
proceed
by
thanking
the
counterparty
for
the
nice
conversation
and
say
something
along
the
lines
of
nice
meeting
you
maybe
we'll
see
yall
around
this
past
weekend
me
and
my
buddy
went
through
the
usual
behavior
of
taking
a
lap
around
the
bar
to
see
if
we
spotted
any
cute
girls
that
we
could
chat
with
we
did
i
approached
and
asked
about
their
glow
5k
shirts
i
started
talking
to
the
pair
about
what
it
was
and
the
general
concept
of
the
race
one
girl
we'll
call
her
right
girl
because
she
was
standing
on
the
right
really
hit
it
off
with
my
friend
started
conversing
well
and
they
seemed
to
be
enjoying
each
others
company
my
friend
and
right
girl
were
laughing
along
and
engaging
each
other
in
the
conversation
the
other
girl
we'll
call
her
left
girl
was
not
having
it
i
get
it
she
wasn't
into
me
i
recognized
it
fairly
quickly
and
i
understand
completely
because
i
occasionally
get
stuck
with
someone
i
don't
want
to
talk
with
i
wasn't
pulling
the
well
known
i'm
wasted
so
let
me
hit
on
you
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
my
man
parts
in
you
routine
or
anything
just
generalized
statement
question
to
spark
an
entertaining
conversation
her
responses
were
confined
to
a
strict
yes
and
no
repertoire
i
got
the
hint
at
that
point
i
told
my
buddy
he
should
try
to
wrap
it
up
pretty
quick
to
grab
a
number
so
they
could
hang
out
later
and
i'd
made
a
lap
left
girl
was
then
left
there
alone
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
chest
looking
off
into
the
distance
without
anyone
to
talk
to
if
you're
at
a
bar
and
you
can
clearly
see
your
friend
is
enjoying
her
time
in
the
company
of
someone
why
not
just
chat
up
his
friend
so
she
can
be
happy
this
isn't
a
question
of
why
she
wasn't
into
me
at
all
because
i
understand
it
happens
every
girl
isn't
into
me
and
i'm
not
into
every
girl
i
meet
it's
more
like
if
you
see
you're
friend
having
a
great
time
why
not
just
chat
up
the
counter
party
so
the
pair
can
continue
having
a
nice
conversation
why
go
to
a
bar
if
you're
going
to
be
offended
if
someone
comes
up
to
you
and
wants
to
have
a
genuine
conversation
about
trivial
matters
why
ruin
your
friends
fun
when
you
could
be
entertained
for
a
bit
yourself
maybe
someone
wrapped
her
tampon
in
sand
paper
or
maybe
she
genuinly
hated
all
people
i'm
not
sure
but
i
hope
that
lady
found
a
nice
conversation
that
night
tl
dr
why
not
just
be
friendly
with
someone
so
your
friend
can
continue
enjoying
someone
else's
conversation

so
i
have
a
huge
dick
and
it's
hard
having
sex
with
my
petite
girlfriend
i
can
satisfy
her
but
it's
not
as
satisfying
for
me
because
i
have
to
be
careful
and
she
can
only
take
some
of
me
not
the
whole
thing
at
first
i
thought
this
could
be
a
problem
but
then
realized
how
much
of
a
hypocrite
i
would
feel
if
the
problem
was
the
other
way
around
and
i
was
too
small
and
couldn't
satisfy
her
i
love
her
for
her
and
since
then
we've
been
happily
together
for
the
past
few
years
and
although
sex
isn't
exactly
what
i
want
it
to
be
i
look
forward
to
marrying
this
girl
someday

i
got
into
bayit
but
i
don't
know
whether
to
accept
it
or
not
cause
i'm
worried
about
possible
roommates
anyone
chill
thinking
about
doing
it
i
always
tend
to
fall
for
the
straight
girl
i
just
want
to
be
in
a
relationship
already
where
are
the
single
lesbians
one
time
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
had
a
dream
about
two
of
my
friends
both
of
which
were
guys
who
wore
girl
pants
and
had
straightened
hair
and
girlish
faces
in
the
dream
they
made
out
with
each
other
i
woke
up
and
it
was
a
wet
dream
i'm
100
sure
i'm
straight
given
that
fact
wtf
lol
i
hate
when
people
get
in
the
left
dammed
lane
and
drive
slow
fast
lane
is
for
speeding
and
if
you
get
in
my
way
ill
ride
your
ass
you
think
i
drive
a
"60,000"
lifted
truck
with
a
guard
on
it
just
to
sit
behind
your
corolla
get
the
fuck
out
of
the
lane
or
ill
get
so
far
up
your
ass
youll
pay
for
it
wanna
slam
on
your
brakes
or
go
slow
fine
but
when
i
hit
you
its
your
dammed
fault
ive
got
insurance
i
pay
a
lot
for
for
a
reason
so
i
hope
you
do
too
what
do
you
do
when
an
old
crush
that
you
still
kinda
like
starts
talking
to
you
as
a
rebound
after
he
breaks
up
with
his
gf
i
mean
i
like
him
but
i
don't
want
to
just
be
the
rebound
girl
i
am
thoroughly
confused
as
to
why
people
who
don't
attend
a
m
leave
comments
on
this
page
do
they
really
have
that
much
of
a
need
to
belong
losers
more
than
half
of
the
stupid
hateful
comment
replies
that
we
read
on
here
also
come
from
said
people
needless
to
say
it
reflects
poorly
on
our
student
population
yeah
we've
got
a
handful
of
jerks
at
our
school
too
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
you
end
up
finding
on
this
page
i
guess
i
feel
a
bit
territorial
when
it
comes
to
our
school
name
real
confession
time
i
harshly
judge
the
few
people
that
seem
to
like
or
comment
on
every
status
seriously
why
are
you
inserting
yourself
into
everyone's
drama
a
comment
here
or
there
on
something
relevant
to
you
is
fine
and
good
but
when
you
post
on
every
comment
it's
just
annoying
go
have
a
conversation
with
your
friends
stop
using
an
anonymous
confession
page
as
a
social
crutch

i'm
so
tired
of
being
one
of
the
few
people
here
that
doesn't
come
from
money
i
have
barely
enough
and
can't
afford
housing
but
i
have
to
watch
everyone
else
plan
elaborate
vacations
and
study
abroad
trips
i
know
it's
wrong
to
be
jealous
of
money
but
i
can't
help
it
where
are
the
people
like
me
on
this
campus
why
does
it
always
have
to
come
down
to
you
leaving
before
i
say
i
love
youuuuuuuuuu
why
do
i
always
use
the
words
that
cut
the
deepest
when
i
know
how
much
it
hurts
youuuu
oh
baby
why
do
i
do
that
to
you
10005
i
am
a
biology
and
philosophy
major
and
i
am
terrified
of
whales
what
is
wrong
with
me
lol
rice
guys
complaining
about
the
girls
here
have
you
seen
yourselves
what
happened
to
cc
compliments
12063
for
all
of
you
who
took
biog1500
cornell
ithaca
is
kind
of
like
iron
in
the
nutrient
enrichment
lab
you
need
it
to
grow
properly
but
when
you
get
too
much
of
it
it
can
be
toxic
i
think
we're
reaching
the
point
of
toxicity
luckily
summer
is
a
week
away
who
else
is
excited
i
am
so
tired
of
the
way
my
boyfriend
treats
me
when
he
is
with
his
family
every
time
he
is
around
his
family
he
completely
ignores
me
it
is
like
i
literally
don't
exist
i
am
not
asking
for
him
to
be
on
the
phone
for
hours
with
me
but
i
do
wish
he
would
send
me
a
little
text
saying
i
love
you
or
text
asking
about
my
day
you
would
think
that
after
6
1
2
years
of
dating
that
he
wouldn't
be
embarrassed
to
talk
to
me
in
front
of
his
family
i
feel
like
this
has
a
lot
to
do
with
how
his
family
doesn't
like
me
i
have
tried
so
hard
for
years
to
win
his
family
over
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
i
have
tried
talking
about
all
of
this
with
him
but
nothing
changes
at
this
point
i
am
really
considering
whether
or
not
i'm
willing
to
stick
around
for
this
any
advise
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
but
i'm
actually
very
lonely
and
i
don't
think
anyone
can
tell
because
i
constantly
have
a
smile
on
my
face
and
i
crack
jokes
all
the
time
i
think
it
is
because
most
of
my
friends
are
more
like
a
weird
middle
between
friend
and
acquaintance
and
no
one
really
knows
who
i
am
i've
tried
branching
outside
my
college
i
even
coadvised
but
the
only
thing
i've
gotten
is
more
acquaintances
how
do
you
bridge
the
gap
between
saying
oh
lets
hang
out
at
every
damn
party
and
pub
to
actually
hanging
out
help
an
ag
out
i've
been
at
a
m
two
years
and
decided
i
don't
like
the
friend
group
i'm
with
they're
poisonous
and
i
want
a
new
start
what
can
a
junior
girl
do
to
meet
new
friends
i
feel
so
alone
and
right
now
i
don't
even
have
a
roommate
for
the
next
year
who
is
the
cop
i
see
all
the
time
on
campus
342
i'm
in
a
fraternity
that
means
unless
i
am
in
phi
psi
i
must
drink
until
i
sleep
at
which
point
one
of
my
boys
will
assist
me
in
taking
more
handle
pulls
wear
fuckloads
of
pastel
sail
daddy's
yacht
and
slay
box
like
charlie
sheen
oh
yeah
i
like
sports
too
like
beer
pong
i
do
it
for
the
kids
all
of
the
above
is
true
except
for
slaying
box
on
box
and
the
yacht
i'm
poor
fuck
you
anyways
i'm
actually
old
school
all
about
dating
only
ever
been
with
2
girls
but
i'm
not
ugly
probably
a
7
or
8
come
at
me
bro
i
lift
people
keep
antagonizing
fraternity
men
on
this
page
sure
we
spit
game
we
rail
box
we
tear
that
shit
up
but
only
when
ladies
ask
for
it
usually
from
their
knees
we
talk
about
last
night's
questionable
deeds
just
as
much
as
girls
example
waldo
watup
playa
did
you
bone
sally
last
night
sadam
yeah
man
sex
was
bomb
waldo
same
sadam
got
some
crabs
though
waldo
same
shit
happens
on
the
reg
minus
the
crabs
kudos
ladies
and
it's
the
biggest
turnoff
for
guys
like
me
but
please
keep
letting
that
happen
it's
for
the
greater
good
never
tryin
to
cblock
a
bro
just
keep
in
mind
that
spreadin
em
makes
you
way
less
appealing
to
guys
like
me
it's
not
just
our
fault
that
there's
virtually
no
dating
scene
at
lafayette
that's
a
two
way
street
if
we
act
like
prey
theyll
act
like
predators
alyxandra
harvey
pure
truth
out
of
the
babe's
mouth
what
she
failed
to
mention
is
how
easy
you
make
yourselves
for
us
to
snatch
see
what
i
did
there
i
see
what
you're
doing
ladies
and
i
don't
like
it
here's
my
last
to
cents
it's
another
quote
homo
fraternicus
is
educated
watup
love
will
find
a
way
through
paths
where
wolves
fear
to
prey
lord
byron
he's
a
fuckin

and
game

is
on

let's
go
sincerely
your
friendly

my
roommates
disgusting
they
smell
they
are
sticky
they
say
things
that
are
horrible
everything
is
covered
in
semen
i
broke
a
blanket
in
half
do
you
know
where
im
going
with
that
hello
cc
most
of
you
don't
know
me
because
i'm
not
a
very
involved
person
with
friends
and
stuff
i
usually
keep
to
myself
and
if
i'm
lucky
there
is
one
or
two
people
around
i
like
hanging
out
with
and
about
10
acquaintances
whom
i
like
catching
up
with
occasionally
the
rest
of
you
all
are
just
people
like
everyone
else
with
the
difference
being
that
you
are
all
either
capable
of
having
engaging
intellectual
discussions
or
have
some
kind
of
charming
skill
that
make
you
stand
out
but
i
don't
really
care
about
these
most
of
the
time
i'm
usually
neutral
about
everyone
around
me
there
are
some
transitional
months
of
depression
when
i
hate
you
all
everything
you
do
annoys
me
and
i
can't
stand
seeing
you
around
me
but
then
there
are
some
times
when
you
are
all
lovely
smart
human
beings
who
are
so
full
of
interesting
ideas
and
are
fascinating
universes
to
discover
so
why
am
i
writing
all
these
things
i
think
about
you
people
who
cares
that's
a
good
question
because
other
than
one
or
two
freaks
who
care
about
everything
no
one
cares
but
you
know
what
i
don't
care
if
you
care
or
not
i'm
still
writing
this
because
i'm
struggling
like
most
of
you
are
right
now
life
is
hard
and
i
want
to
connect
to
people
it
doesn't
always
happen
connecting
a
large
amount
of
people
i'll
try
i'm
at
a
point
in
my
life
where
if
you
ask
me
i
absolutely
cannot
think
of
a
single
thing
i
would
like
to
be
doing
i
sincerely
don't
want
to
do
anything
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
so
badly
that
i
don't
even
want
to
do
nothing
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
doing
things
but
not
doing
things
is
also
doing
something
there
is
an
effort
involved
with
not
doing
things
i'm
stuck
in
this
floating
condition
everything
i
used
to
hold
on
to
for
my
sanity
are
starting
to
get
loose
identity
home
friendship
curiosity
discovery
they
don't
make
as
much
sense
anymore
everything
i
enjoy
doing
feels
like
an
artificial
escape
and
they
will
soon
slip
away
from
my
hands
leaving
me
stranded
in
meaninglessness
this
sound
familiar
to
you
i'm
sure
it
does
i
know
everyone
who
is
reading
this
has
experienced
this
or
is
struggling
with
it
currently
we
are
all
human
and
this
state
of
mind
is
a
very
uniquely
human
thing
we
feel
alone
i
for
example
feel
lonely
as
fuck
right
now
i
know
there
are
people
who
love
me
but
i
still
feel
lonely
i
see
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
but
i
can't
get
my
heart
to
feel
it
too
if
anyone
tells
me
that
i'm
important
i
matter
its
not
really
news
to
me
but
my
mind
doesn't
work
that
way
it
likes
to
dive
deep
into
labyrinths
of
doom
with
each
dead
end
the
terrible
thoughts
reflect
and
grow
bigger
fill
the
air
and
drown
any
breathing
creature
that
i've
been
raising
fondly
in
my
head
there
is
no
real
solution
to
states
like
this
i
could
tell
you
to
go
be
with
your
friends
but
sometimes
you
don't
have
friends
or
you
do
but
they
don't
give
you
that
space
of
comfort
i
could
tell
you
to
smoke
weed
or
get
drunk
or
do
drugs
a
temporary
solution
i
myself
sometimes
resort
to
but
it
just
makes
you
weaker
when
you
are
sober
i
can't
give
you
solutions
if
i
could
give
you
solutions
i
would
solve
my
own
issues
in
the
first
place
so
writing
this
doesn't
make
sense
because
it
is
not
going
to
help
you
in
any
way
i'm
only
writing
this
to
show
you
that
i
a
completely
random
person
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
someone
you
wouldn't
look
at
twice
i
am
the
same
person
as
you
i
relate
to
you
even
if
i
don't
want
to
we
are
going
through
the
same
shit
and
we'll
be
fine
in
the
end
because
if
there
was
ever
a
solution
and
we
could
lead
perfect
lives
that
would
be
a
problem
on
its
own
or
maybe
not
maybe
it
would
just
be
perfect
and
we
would
live
and
die
in
perfection
but
who
knows
that
condition
will
never
exist
in
the
messed
up
swamp
of
shit
we
are
all
sunk
in
we'll
live
on
and
we'll
cry
and
we'll
laugh
and
we'll
keep
being
basically
all
the
same
creatures
and
that's
why
i
could
anyone
tell
me
what
those
loud
apocalyptic
noises
were
today
saturday
that
sounded
like
they
were
flying
over
campus
i
couldn't
tell
if
it
was
wind
or
some
kind
of
aircraft
i
was
having
a
dream
about
the
end
of
the
world
when
i
work
up
to
vvvvvrbroroskddmmmmmm
flying
over
my
dorm
i
thought
judgment
day
had
come
for
a
few
minutes
need
some
advice
i
have
been
great
with
everything
else
but
eating
pussy
any
magic
advice
from
girls
14511
is
comm
considered
a
joke
major
at
cornell
can
comm
majors
actually
find
jobs
after
graduation
when
my
roommate
goes
into
our
bedroom
alone
the
internet
magically
starts
stuttering
what
could
he
be
doing
in
there
that
hogs
all
that
bandwidth

school
and
classes
have
crushed
my
love
for
learning
i
am
really
a
curious
person
and
love
learning
about
new
things
or
new
concepts
but
homework
and
exams
and
strict
grades
ruin
all
of
that
looking
forward
to
auditing
a
class
abroad
does
it
matter
if
i
don't
study
for
that
class
at
all
just
enjoy
the
learning

ladies
of
cornell
i
just
had
an
idea
if
you
feel
a
guy's
penis
is
too
small
why
not
just
do
anal
smaller
less
lube
discomfort
for
you
tighter
for
him
both
parties
happy
boom
problem
solved
6731
i
wish
you
would
just
tell
me
how
you
feel
i'm
tired
of
always
making
the
first
move
and
i'm
honestly
about
to
move
on
but
the
things
your
friends
keep
telling
me
are
the
only
thing
that's
keeping
me
around
why
can't
you
be
as
honest
with
me
as
you
are
with
them
i'm
not
very
technologically
savvy
but
is
the
piratebay
still
a
reliable
source
or
is
the
nsa
going
to
snatch
me
from
my
bed
one
night

i
wonder
if
the
person
running
this
page
knows
who
each
confession
belongs
to
we
have
no
idea
unless
you
message
us

is

i'm
a
prefrosh
coming
to
cornell
is
cornell
really
like
this
page
makes
it
seem
to
be
because
i'm
getting
a
completely
different
impression
from
the
one
i
got
when
i
decided
to
attend
cornell
there's
a
really
cute
guy
on
craigslist
that
i
am
kind
of
interested
in
but
i
don't
know
if
i
want
to
stoop
to
that
level
then
again
i
checked
craigslist
so
am
i
already
there
suicide
is
a
crime
in
some
places
on
earth
always
wondered
why
so
i
am
a
graduating
senior
and
don't
feel
like
applying
myself
at
all
my
gpa
is
pretty
much
set
no
hope
for
honors
but
over
a
3.0
and
just
want
to
relax
all
the
time
any
ideas
on
how
to
keep
motivated
to
the
cute
girl
with
the
shaved
buzzed
hair
and
dangly
earrings
i
saw
in
rastall
today
11

who
are
you
i
feel
like
i
see
you
around
a
lot
but
obviously
not
enough
to
know
your
name
you
seem
like
a
really
friendly
person
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
know
you
sincerely
the
girl
who
sort
of
smiled
and
then
sat
at
the
table
next
to
you
because
she
was
too
shy
to
start
a
conversation
i
just
saw
a
commercial
where
a
horse
race
full
of
terminator
ponies
gets
beaten
by
an
actual
real
horse
that
turns
into
an
acura
dat
cray
wat
do
i
go
to
tufts
university
great
school
and
all
but
i
know
that
if
i
got
accepted
into
georgetown
i'd
bounce
in
a
heartbeat
why
cause
hoya
fuckin
saxa
that's
why
1412
when
someone
stabs
you
in
the
back
and
then
thinks
you
will
still
be
their
friend
you're
fucking
joking
right
8405
are
there
any
girls
at
cornell
who
golf
i
find
it
extremely
attractive
if
a
girl
plays
golf
and
would
love
to
meet
one
that
does
so
we
can
play
when
it's
warm
enough
to
after
going
through
a
lot
of
body
image
shit
for
a
long
long
time
i
finally
feel
incredible
about
my
body
i
am
strong
and
healthy
but
i'm
scared
because
i'm
no
longer
either
the
thin
girl
that
i
once
was
or
the
soft
curvy
girl
that
i
also
once
was
i
won't
be
appealing
to
anyone
i
feel
great
about
myself
so
that's
the
first
step
but
what
about
someone
else
740
it
makes
me
sad
every
time
i
think
about
what
my
bf's
mom
thinks
about
me
i
know
i
am
not
the
best
girl
in
the
world
but
i
do
have
some
good
qualities
what
sucks
is
that
i
was
introduced
as
a
friend
not
a
girlfriend
imagine
if
she
finds
out
she
will
flip
the
fuck
out
i
really
don't
get
it
i
have
only
met
her
once
how
can
she
judge
me
base
on
a
simple
conversation
i
was
very
polite
and
friendly
what
sucks
the
most
is
that
my
boyfriend
never
defended
me
i
don't
think
he
will
ever
have
the
guts
to
talk
back
to
his
mom
and
it
hurts
cause
his
family
makes
me
feel
so
unwanted
and
unworthy
sometimes
when
i
doubt
our
relationship
i
tell
myself
that
i
deserve
a
real
man
someone
that
will
man
the
fuck
up
for
me
instead
of
being
mama's
little
baby
taking
pictures
during
or
after
role
call
at
muster
should
be
considered
bad
bull
the
screens
and
or
the
flashes
are
distracting
will
the
world
end
if
you
don't
share
it
on
facebook
or
will
going
be
pointless
if
everyone
doesn't
know
you
went
382
why
don't
you
call
me
yet

who
at
georgetown
gives
great
head
this
is
for
a
science
class
so
i
moved
to
the
us
a
few
years
ago
and
had
a
road
trip
with
my
mum
to
different
parts
of
texas
and
one
of
the
first
stops
was
san
antonio
to
visit
my
sister
while
being
there
we
went
to
the
mall
and
i
met
this
guy
jc
caylen
who
at
the
moment
was
an
up
and
coming
youtuber
we
got
along
great
and
kept
in
touch
he
now
has
over
1
million
subscribers
on
his
main
channel
and
is
part
of
the
worlds
biggest
collab
channel
o2l
i've
watched
him
come
this
far
and
through
him
i
have
been
blessed
to
meet
a
bunch
of
known
youtubers
and
viners
like
connor
franta
grace
helbig
nash
grier
miranda
sings
charles
trippy
troye
sivan
tyler
oakley
zoe
sugg
caspar
lee
and
the
list
goes
on
they
are
all
such
a
huge
part
of
my
life
but
i
keep
having
to
hide
it
because
i've
seen
how
their
fandoms
get
possesive
and
jealous
about
close
friends
of
them
i
don't
like
the
attention
and
i've
been
hiding
this
huge
part
of
my
life
for
a
while
cause
i'm
also
scared
to
make
friends
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
or
get
used
what
do
you
say
aggies
should
i
make
my
connections
with
them
public
or
tell
only
my
close
friends
i'm
a
girl

my
friend
got
a
bid
for
sigma
chi
during
rush
a
few
years
back
and
the
only
thought
that
came
to
my
mine
was
why
do
bad
things
happen
to
good
people
just
had
sex
in
the
basement
of
the
library
how's
your
fourth
week
going
10
saw
a
kid
named
mark
at
the
ccc
tonight
and
i
swear
he
looked
just
like
sheldon
from
the
big
bang
theory
is
it
wrong
that
i
couldn't
help
but
to
stare
1489
alright
so
call
me
paranoid
but
let's
try
a
thought
experiment
i
trust
the
folks
that
run
this
site
are
authentically
one
of
us
aka
lc
student
s
right
the
individual
that
runs
this
site
is
probably
one
of
our
friends
but
okay
let's
step
back
a
few
past
time
scales
this
confesson
missed
connection
trend
in
universities
colleges
kinda
hit
us
all
at
the
same
time
when
it
sprung
up
i
saw
confession
sites
from
my
friend's
schools
on
the
newsfeed
you
know
you
guys
too
alright
so
as
far
as
i
know
no
one
knows
who
runs
this
site
it's
anonymous
as
fuck
maybe
the
source
is
some
external
data
base
like
a
collector
of
information
collecting
from
every
college
university
this
site
is
becoming
a
publicly
recycled
communal
diary
we
are
pouring
our
most
intimate
information
of
ourselves
into
this
anonymous
face
s
i
am
paranoid
i
guess
so
person
who
runs
this
site
should
totally
just
give
us
the
word
that
you
are
an
lc
student
so
we
can
have
the
faith
that
you
are

admin
says
i'm
definitely
an
lc
student
i
have
no
clue
how
to
really
prove
it
though
so
you'll
just
have
to
take
me
at
my
word
on
that
one
i
guess
happy
holidays
you
420
philosopher
you
sometimes
i
masterbate
at
night
while
my
boyfriend
is
sleeping
next
to
me
i
get
him
off
all
the
time
but
he
doesn't
always
return
the
favor
hey
a
girls
gotta
do
what
a
girls
do
right
does
anyone
know
a
good
party
where
i
can
get
ratchet
to
twerking
music
i'm
tired
of
awkwardly
jumping
up
and
down
to
techno
i'm
a
straight
female
who
has
noticed
that
the
the
females
at
unh
are
a
lot
better
looking
than
most
of
the
males
here
when
i
get
drunk
i'm
bicurious
like
most
biddies
and
the
guys
love
it
when
i
make
out
with
gorgeous
ladies
would
they
still
cheer
me
on
if
i
wanted
to
marry
one
of
them
5815
i
find
the
cigarette
smoking
here
absolutely
ridiculous
you
could
be
one
dumb
fuck
and
still
know
that
smoking
cigarettes
is
undoubtedly
bad
for
you
i
understand
if
you
come
from
europe
and
have
been
doing
it
for
a
few
years
but
for
those
kids
who
come
here
and
start
doing
it
to
look
cool
well
news
flash
you're
not
you
are
filling
your
lungs
with
garbage
and
making
your
breath
and
clothes
smell
no
one
is
going
to
want
to
kiss
you
not
to
mention
is
lung
cancer
worth
it
seriously
people
go
smoke
some
damn
pot
is
it
to
much
to
ask
for
an
attractive
intelligent
and
tall
woman
who
can
cook
delicious
food
and
doesn't
mind
cleaning
but
can
also
have
a
stimulating
intellectual
conversation
to
come
into
my
life
i
guess
so
what
do
you
women
think
about
guys
who
smoke
weed
turn
off
turn
on
neutral
theres
plenty
of
people
who
drink
alcohol
but
not
everyone
likes
to
go
to
the
park
after
dark
and
smoke
that
tumbleweed
11480
how
do
you
know
that
the
person
you
are
with
is
the
one
i
can
see
myself
marrying
him
and
having
a
decent
life
but
i
can
also
see
myself
with
another
man
i
really
want
to
hang
out
with
that
guy
more
because
he
makes
me
feel
butterflies
a
part
of
me
thinks
that
i
just
haven't
met
the
right
person
yet
because
i
can
see
myself
in
love
with
a
few
different
men
it
is
hard
to
pick
one
person
for
some
reason
i've
had
this
extreme
sexual
attraction
to
the
douchey
frat
bros
and
cocky
assholes
that
litter
big
universities
why
do
i
want
one
so
badly
i
wish
i
were
trolling
i
have
many
friends
and
i
am
in
a
happy
relationship
however
when
i
am
not
with
my
so
or
friends
i
feel
so
alone
obviously
i'm
alone
so
i
should
feel
alone
but
the
magnitude
of
my
sense
of
solitude
is
too
much
i
hate
being
alone
is
this
normal
anybody
know
the
romantic
status
of
junior
dan
short
polite
involved
with
grow
that
one
17218
the
last
form
of
communication
between
us
was
this
weird
hairless
thing
cupped
in
hands
thursday
weeks
and
a
season
later
it
has
a
name
puggle
why
the
hell
did
you
send
me
a
picture
of
a
baby
echidna
no
idea
but
everyone
who's
an
indescribable
butt
to
me
is
henceforth
a
puggle
thanks
for
the
word
so
sorry
for
being
a
clingy
f
ck
i'm
3
weeks
pregnant
and
i
don't
know
how
to
tell
my
family
without
them
freaking
the
fuck
out
on
top
of
that
i
haven't
even
told
the
father
who
is
my
best
friend's
boyfriend
advice
8681
i
feel
a
balcony
scene
coming
on
peeper
peeper
wherefore
art
thou
peeper
reject
thy
father
and
refuse
thy
name
soft
what
light
through
yonder
window
breaks
it
is
the
east
and
blonde
girl
is
the
sun
arise
fair
sun
and
kill
the
envious
moon
who
is
already
sick
and
pale
with
greif
3768
it
really
pisses
me
off
how
so
many
people
here
are
obsessed
with
social
hierarchy
why
should
we
care
about
this
we're
all
adults
10152
i
think
it's
weird
how
you
people
care
about
what
schools
people
go
to
like
i
literally
haven't
even
thought
about
cornell
compared
to
other
schools
since
the
first
week
of
my
freshman
year
since
then
its
just
been
college
the
only
people
i
meet
who
do
this
are
freshman
like
it's
so
bad
it
makes
me
uncomfortable
listening
and
reading
it
it's
almost
as
bad
as
hearing
a
senior
talking
about
how
many
ap
tests
he
passed
in
high
school
like
really
that
shit
is
cringeworthy

if
you
put
your
ear
on
the
inner
thigh
of
a
complete
stranger

a
public
bus

hear
them
say

be
tryna
hit

i
am
really
attracted
to
a
girl
who
is
a
different
race
than
me
i
don't
care
about
race
but
then
again
what
if
she
does
i
honestly
don't
get
it
why
is
everyone
so
addicted
to
this
page
i
feel
like
i
don't
see
enough
interracial
couples
around
campus
what
does
a
chocolate
female
have
to
do
to
get
some
vanilla
around
here
how
do
you
lady's
feel
about

had
opportunity
and

took
it
any

out
because
i
don't
drink
unh
students

patrol
killed
it
last
night
does
campus
security
hire
hot
girls
just
to
watch
them
strut
around
either
way
im
digging
it
52

have
you
not
seen
jimmy
4761
food
for
thought
why
do
women
fight
for
equality
and
yet
in
the
same
breath
deem
themselves
victims
if
irresponsible
sex
happens
after
a
night
of
drunken
partying
i
confess
that
i
think
this
is
bullshit
are
they
not
equally
drunk
were
they
forced
to
get
shit
faced
no
some
of
them
not
all
made
poor
decisions
under
clouded
judgement
and
regretted
it
so
girls
of
georgetown
remember
this
your
regrets
can
cost
someone
their
freedom
their
reputation
if
you
don't
care
and
think
yourself
completely
free
from
accountability
then
you
are
just
as
much
of
a
monster

i
don't
want
to
graduate
because
everyone
will
move
after
i
don't
want
to
move
on
with
life
after
college
why
can't
people
just
stay
where
they
are
i
feel
like
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
meaningless
hookup
a
connection
is
a
connection
whatever
way
it
happens
to
come
along
things
don't
have
to
be
deep
and
soulful
and
emotional
to
have
meaning
u
feel
me
8085
your
personality
sucks
and
i'm
trying
so
hard
to
get
through
to
you
and
have
you
open
up
and
you
are
actually
the
most
difficult
person
i
have
ever
met
what's
wrong
with
you
and
for
that
matter
what's
wrong
with
me
for
wanting
to
be
close
to
you
i
really
like
you
and
have
for
a
while
you
seem
like
such
a
great
guy
and
i
want
nothing
more
than
to
get
to
know
you
better
we've
been
talking
on
facebook
and
i
really
want
your
number
but
am
too
scared
to
ask
for
it
please
give
me
some
sign
if
you
like
me
back
am
i
the
only
one
looking
forward
to
meeting
some
new
cute
freshmen
girls
i
keep
using
my
vibrator
when
i
think
my
roommate's
asleep
but
then
she
wakes
up
and
gets
so
mad
at
me
what
should
i
do
to
pleasure
myself
in
secret
super
annoyed
at
t.u
students
for
making
fun
of
us
because
obama
isn't
speaking
here
like
really
i'm
sure
he
is
speaking
there
because
it's
in
austin
as
in
the
capital
that's
the
only
reason
anything
even
happens
there
is
it
weird
if
i
legitimately
wanna
get
to
know
some
of
the
people
on
this
page
i
would
really
like
to
just
hang
out
or
talk
to
allyson
jeremy
merrick
rory
luis
devon
tori
etc
i
promise
i'm
not
being
weird
i
just
love
meeting
new
people
and
seeing
how
many
different
personalities
are
in
this
unique
world
2271
i
couldn't
decide
if
this
should
be
confession
or
missed
connection
but
i
just
wanted
the
opportunity
to
say
fuck
you
to
everyone
who
runs
past
the
door
to
sneak
into
the
bon
i
wonder
how
many
of
you
would
never
consider
dining
dashing
at
a
real
restaurant
and
how
you
make
the
distinction
sneaking
into
the
bon
is
the
exact
same
thing
just
in
reverse
order
every
person
who
does
this
is
directly
contributing
to
any
increase
in
restrictions
change
in
policy
that
would
make
your
dining
experience
worse
and
if
you're
doing
this
in
an
attempt
to
stick
it
to
the
administration
or
whatever
it's
misguided
because
when
profits
go
down
student
workers
are
the
first
ones
to
go
so
as
a
person
who
works
the
door
i
start
to
worry
about
losing
my
job
every
time
i
don't
manage
to
stop
someone
from
sneaking
in
ugh
when
talking
to
supervisors
about
whether
i
should
confront
people
or
not
they
have
expressed
interest
in
talking
to
students
when
they
really
have
a
problem
can't
pay
just
a
reminder
that
most
people
on
this
campus
really
do
want
to
help
students
in
any
way
they
can
6125
to
whomever
is
looking
for
someone
with
kinks
right
there
with
you
how
do
we
start
finding
and
connecting
people

i
really
wanna
have
sex
in
the
stacks
before
i
leave
anyone
in
i'm
a
guy
how
many
ags
play
pokmon
i'm
just
curious
does
anyone
know
if
that
junior
miles
griffiths
has
a
facebook
i
want
him
on
my
body
how
do
i
tell
my
roommate
that
she's
actually
really
mean
i
am
so
tired
of
the
terrible
stigma
cc
puts
on
serious
or
long
distance
relationships
i
shouldn't
feel
embarrassed
or
ashamed
to
tell
people
that
my
long
distance
boyfriend
and
i
are
incredibly
committed
to
each
other
and
plan
on
living
the
rest
of
our
lives
together
why
can't
we
just
celebrate
love
and
be
happy
for
each
other
i
don't
give
you
shit
for
hooking
up
with
a
new
person
every
weekend
if
that's
your
thing
then
go
for
it
just
please
give
me
the
same
respect
as
i
give
you
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
https
bitly.com
19ldu1e
it
hurts
when
your
best
friend
lies
to
you
i
mean
we
grew
up
together
i
thought
we
would
always
say
everything
to
each
other
what
happened
right
you
felt
ashamed
but
lying
to
me
was
not
the
answer
i
would've
helped
you
i
am
sad
that
i
lost
you
you
said
that
i
was
going
to
be
the
best
girl
in
you
weeding
the
godmother
to
your
offsprings
now
what
it
went
all
down
the
drain
i
forgive
you
but
nothing
will
be
the
same
have
a
great
life
i
love
you
what
if
a
and
r
are
the
same
person
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
https

it
seriously
pisses
me
off
that
the
school
can
spend
25
million
on
a
new
stadium
100k
on
a
new
logo
but
still
justify
charging
me
30
k
a
year
as
an
out
of
state
student
and
when
i
can't
pay
my
bill
on
time
they
drop
me
and
now
i
risk
expulsion
how
about
you
take
that
money
and
give
it
to
the
kids
who
financially
need
the
aid
or
would
that
be
not
in
your
best
interest
as
it
looks
like
you
act
like
a
for
profit
university
i
think
i
may
be
asexual
i
want
a
relationship
a
companion
but
have
no
desire
to
have
a
physical
relationship
one
night
i
was
researching
it
and
one
of
my
friends
read
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
what
i
was
reading
about
they
laughed
at
the
idea
of
it
and
made
it
out
to
be
a
bad
thing
it's
not
is
it
so
do
white
guys
really
prefer
asian
girls

this
song
i
wrote
accurately
describes
how
i
have
felt
for
a
while
my
song
verse
1
just
a
little
boy
and
he's
made
of
wood
and
he
lived
a
life
like
all
boys
should
but
something's
wrong
doesn't
feel
right
lies
awake
lies
awake
alone
at
night
just
thinking
bout
the
world
where
i
find
my
place
empty
expressions
on
my
wooden
face
don't
do
me
justice
nuts
and
bolts
are
rusting
away
rusting
away
verse
2
the
world
outside
is
calling
me
a
tug
of
war
with
two
ripped
sleeves
terrified
of
what's
to
come
he
drops
down
to
his
aching
knees
and
asks
for
closure
to
his
war
pray
expectations
come
to
cease
all
these
pressures
make
it
hard
to
love
and
harder
to
breathe
so
i
ran
away
took
all
my
dreams
abandoned
all
my
memories
chorus
blue
fairy
don't
fail
me
now
im
stuck
inside
a
fairytale
wonder
why
the
world
is
spinning
in
first
place
but
i'm
not
winning
need
some
reassurance
i
won't
be
burned
inside
a
furnace
wanna
feel
a
real
heartbeat
a
flame
to
light
my
purpose
bridge
and
i
wonder
if
geppetto
even
stopped
to
wonder
how
i'd
feel
would
i
feel
real
a
product
of
convention
a
maple
imperfection
a
lie
that
no
one
knows
a
wooden
nose
that
grows
so
i
ran
away
took
all
my
dreams
abandoned
all
my
memories
in
search
of
my
blue
fairy
chorus
blue
fairy
don't
fail
me
now
im
stuck
inside
a
fairytale
wonder
why
the
world
is
spinning
in
first
place
but
i'm
not
winning
need
some
reassurance
i
won't
be
burned
inside
a
furnace
wanna
feel
a
real
heartbeat
a
flame
to
light
my
purpose
instrumental
chorus
that
is
all
437
i
like
a
guy
here
we're
friends
but
we've
only
known
each
other
for
a
couple
weeks
do
i
tell
him
i
like
him
soon
wait
several
weeks
to
see
if
it's
mutual
or
other
advice
16791
honestly
i
am
completely
appalled
by
the
state
of
the
2nd
floor
women's
restroom
in
baker
tower
big
c
i
barely
know
where
to
begin
first
of
all
there's
hair
everywhere
on
the
floor
in
the
sink
on
the
counter
in
the
shower
it's
nasty
secondly
there
is
the
trash
that's
fallen
around
the
trash
can
which
is
not
full
by
the
way
you're
just
not
trying
to
get
it
in
the
trash
also
who
put
a
paper
towel
or
toilet
paper
in
the
sink
that's
really
disgusting
to
look
at
if
you're
trying
to
brush
your
teeth
or
wash
your
hands
we
go
to
an
ivy
league
school
you'd
think
the
students
here
would
have
the
dignity
to
maintain
a
decent
bathroom
personally
i
would
be
embarrassed
to
know
that
i
made
the
bathroom
look
like
that
so
maybe
you
coughcoughmyneighbors
should
at
least
try
to
make
it
look
like
a
bathroom
at
a
nice
school
instead
of
the
pigsty
it
is
right
now
what
happened
to
that
taylor
girl
taylor
steine
i
think
i
wanted
to
get
with
her
but
she
kind
of
disappeared
hope
she's
okay

this
page
is
about
posting
confessions
that
could
be
construed
as
comical
not
bitching
about
other
people
or
groups
that
you
don't
like
with
that
in
mind
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
enjoyed
the
satirical
tone
of
the
following
passage
i
would
like
to
carefully
deconstruct
your
letter
my
thoughts
in
parentheses
in
response
to
40
i
just
want
to
clarify
its
not
just
dg's
that
act
like
this
really
it's
a
shock
to
me
that
some
girls
that
go
to
a
"60,000"
a
year
private
institution
are
stuck
up
also
the
center
point
of
your
attack
hinges
on
the
fact
that
this
person
was
insulting
dg
in
reality
they
were
just
giving
an
example
kappas
tri
delts
and
even
alpha
phis
are
guilty
of
this
even
alpha
phis
nooooooooo
also
what
evidence
do
we
have
that
aka
pi
phi
theta
and
g
phi
b
also
don't
possess
these
characteristics
and
you
wonder
why
the
only
girls
i
hit
and
quit
are
in
sororities
anyone
that
actually
says
hit
it
and
quit
it
is
most
likely
a
virgin
wanna
know
what
my
favorite
past
time
is
treating
dumb
ho's
like
dumb
ho's
i
like
to
disrespect
women
as
well
anyways
non
sorority
girls
are
way
more
prettier
and
don't
even
know
it
elizabeth
dillon
has
openings
in
her
english
101
course
i
suggest
you
check
it
out
it's
probably
way
more
awesomer
than
any
of
your
other
english
courses
sorry
sorority
girls
but
the
sorority
gave
you
a
shitty
personality
and
probably
clymadia
unless
your
a
dg
than
you
probably
never
kissed
a
boy
chlamydia
you're
you've
or
you
have
is
acceptable
as
well
see
professor
dillon
for
more
information
but
but
but
there
are
chill
sorority
girls
that
didn't
let
the
sorority
go
to
their
head
but
only
a
select
few
as
a
dude
i'd
like
to
speak
for
the
greek
ladies
of
pepperdine
and
say
that
i've
met
quite
a
few
nice
ones
that
are
neither
arrogant
nor
carriers
of
any
venereal
disease
i
want
to
thank
every
one
of
you
and
btw
i
can't
wait
till
everybody
finds
out
that
i
wrote
this
just
because
our
school
is
so
small
and
everybody
cares
about
each
others
business
so
so
much
666
mothafucka
the
gist
of
what
i
have
gathered
from
this
letter
is
that
you
have
little
to
no
respect
for
women
you
are
most
likely
an
unaffiliated
student
or
possibly
in
an
m
night
shamylanian
twist
a
girl
gasp
and
if
you
truly
thought
you
were
going
to
be
found
out
you
might
as
well
have
just
commented
on
40
lastly
i
am
guilty
of
many
of
the
things
i
accused
42
of
i
have
poor
grammatical
skillz
sometimes
i
mistreat
women
and
i
most
definitely
have
too
much
time
on
my
hands
but
hell
it's
summer
who
doesn't
however
by
no
means
am
i
person
that
shits
on
whole
groups
of
people
based
on
a
few
encounters
i
think
the
bigger
problem
here
is
that
people
are
judging
based
on
affiliation
rather
than
a
case
by
case
basis
that
message
was
sponsored
by
a
douche
with
too
much
time
now
back
to
your
regularly
scheduled
programming
hey
wildcats
what'd
you
lose
last
night
reminds
of
you
of
anyone
hahha
boys
do
you
like
slow
or
fast
blow
jobs
i
want
everyone
to
come
to
bascom
hill
on
friday
at
4pm
to
be
a
part
of
badger
shake
i
mean
who
can
say
no
to
insane
costumes
in
madison
on
a
friday
threw
a
rocket
of
a
football
pass
to
a
woman
and
she
rewards
me
with
a
kiss
while
pinning
me
down
success
hard
to
tell
at
this
point
i
have
to
admit
that
i
honestly
don't
understand
guys
i
thought
guys
were
supposed
to
be
straightforward
and
say
what
they
mean
like
if
you
don't
like
me
and
all
we
did
was
hook
up
why
would
you
say
that
just
know
it's
not
you
as
a
reason
for
not
texting
just
say
what
you
mean
so
i
can
finally
get
closure
seriously
anybody
out
there
trying
to
let
someone
down
easy
be
clear
that
it
is
over
i
mean
i
am
not
sure
what
i
am
supposed
to
think
should
i
just
ask
she
said
she'd
do
anything
for
me
whenever
i
needed
anything
i'd
turn
to
her
and
she'd
always
ask
what
is
it
with
this
beautiful
look
on
her
face
her
strong
body
underneath
her
clothes
just
aching
to
hold
my
load
first
thing
when
i
woke
i
saw
her
staring
at
me
with
full
love
devotion
and
loyalty
she
made
my
house
feel
like
a
home
and
i
shared
everything
with
her
what
was
mine
was
hers
within
her
deep
brown
eyes
i
knew
there
was
nothing
but
trust
and
devotion
she
was
at
my
side
as
i
traveled
the
world
never
left
me
kept
me
company
when
i
was
lonely
protected
me
when
i
was
weak
shielded
me
from
harm
and
fought
as
equals
she
helped
carry
my
life's
heaviest
of
pains
she
was
with
me
until
the
end
and
i
loved
her
dearly
we
saw
so
much
beauty
but
such
darkness
together
our
lives
united
i
knew
she
was
my
only
true
companion
in
this
world
she
was
sworn
to
carry
my
burdens
i
never
felt
so
conflicted
in
my
life
when
i
betrayed
her
i
hit
her
across
the
back
of
the
head
with
the
wabbajack
and
let
her
die
in
the
woods
lydia
my
love
i
am
so
sorry
but
next
time
carry
my
burden
without
the
fucking
attitude
i
think
it's
stupid
to
make
both
unisex
bathrooms
and
women's
bathrooms
in
the
library
why
shouldn't
men
have
men
bathrooms
like
women
if
a
guy
doesn't
ask
a
girl
out
after
talking
for
3
months
is
it
time
to
kick
the
bucket
has
anyone
else
heard
of
the
phenomenon
called
shadeslang
i've
seen
the
hashtag
around
a
lot
lately
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
looks
pretty
cool
3070
when
i
smoke
pot
i
get
extremely
paranoid
like
beyond
belief
the
other
night
i
smoked
with
some
friends
before
going
to
a
restaurant
and
there
was
a
40
minute
wait
for
a
table
while
standing
and
waiting
people
kept
giving
me
strange
looks
and
moving
away
from
me
and
for
some
reason
i
was
convinced
i
shit
my
pants
i
quickly
dipped
out
and
started
walking
down
the
street
for
a
place
to
check
myself
out
while
hundreds
of
people
kept
laughing
at
me
and
giving
me
strange
looks
my
phone
was
dead
i
was
too
high
to
tell
where
i
was
and
i
probably
circled
the
block
20
times
i
spotted
a
guy
waiting
to
get
buzzed
into
a
building
and
quickly
ran
across
the
street
as
i
followed
him
in
he
turned
around
and
stared
me
up
and
down
what
are
you
doing
i
live
here
oh
ok
he
went
upstairs
and
i
searched
for
a
possible
bathroom
or
private
area
on
the
ground
floor
to
check
myself
out
i
found
a
door
next
to
the
stairs
and
quickly
leaped
for
it
i
opened
the
door
shut
it
and
turned
around
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
kitchen
of
some
restaurant
connected
to
the
building
what
the
fuck
how
did
you
get
in
here
i
shut
the
door
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
headed
back
towards
the
entrance
hallway
the
guy
that
let
me
into
the
building
came
walking
down
the
stairs
stopped
and
looked
me
up
and
down
again
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
live
here
or
not
is
there
a
bathroom
around
here
i
don't
think
so
i
took
a
deep
breath
realizing
i
was
out
of
options
listen
man
i'm
high
as
hell
right
now
and
i
need
you
to
tell
me
if
i
shit
my
pants
what
i
need
you
to
tell
me
if
i
shit
my
pants
what
are
you
high
on
weed
damn
you
got
any
more
i
don't
have
time
for
this
did
i
shit
my
pants
or
not
i
do
a
360
spin
nah
man
you
good
you
sure
like
check
my
legs
and
pocket
area
you
look
good
man
i
walked
out
and
made
it
back
to
my
dorm
an
hour
and
a
half
later
12333
i
love
when
you
text
me
with
last
minute
plans
i
know
we're
just
friends
but
i
think
i
want
us
to
be
more
i
just
wish
you'd
make
a
move
so
i
know
you
feel
the
same
way
i
don't
care
if
we're
seniors
and
moving
apart
we
deserve
a
chance

headed
to

after
being
disowned
for
having
sex
with
my
boyfriend
my
parents
bought
a
female
dog
and
named
it
after
me
now
whenever
i
call
my

on
the
phone
i
always
hear
my

in
the
background
shouting
come
here
you
little
bitch
who's
a
good
bitch
whooo'sss
a
good
bitchhh
yeah
well
guess
what
mama

i
ain't
coming
home
ever

enjoy
your
bitch
because
you're
never
gonna
see
this
one
again

asked
her
out
but
got
no
reply
should
i
bring
it
up
again
or
is
that
a
definite
no
never
know
what
the
future
holds
so
i'm
fine
with
waiting
for
a
bit
14142
i'm
at
the
psp
program
for
cornell
i
wonder
when
i'll
make
truly
good
friends
everyone
seems
too
cautious
let
go
once
in
a
while
you
know
is
this
how
the
rest
of
the
next
four
years
will
be
like
i'm
truly
grateful
for
cornell
honestly
i
just
worry
that
i
won't
find
a
place
to
fit
in
because
i'm
welll
not
shy
people
just
don't
approach
me
even
when
i
approach
them
they're
really
nice
and
i
swear
they
are
my
friends
but
a
couple
hours
later
when
they
see
me
they
pretend
to
have
not
seen
me
why
does
this
happen
cornell
students
are
smart
and
they
know
when
to
respect
people
obviously
but
just
these
psp
students
in
general
seem
to
only
wanna
be
around
the
most
attractive
looking
people
or
the
most
social
ones
while
they
continue
to
pretend
that
the
others
don't
exist
and
if
they
ever
acknowledge
their
existence
it's
because
they
are
probably
alone
themselves
at
the
time
i
don't
know
this
is
just
something
that's
been
bothering
me
14104
because
of
my
past
relationships
i
find
it
hard
to
fully
commit
to
others
now
i'm
not
sure
how
i'm
supposed
to
behave
every
time
i
don't
hear
from
my
significant
other
for
over
a
day
or
two
i'm
worried
that
it's
because
they're
thinking
of
breaking
up
with
me
i
then
obsess
over
this
for
hours
days
until
i
can't
focus
on
anything
else
is
there
something
wrong
with
me
or
am
i
right
to
suspect
that
something
is

this
is
not
criticizing
all
greek
life
two
of
my
best
friends
are
in
a
sorority
and
fraternity
when
i
asked
her
why
she
was
rushing
i
really
like
to
party
and
i
want
to
meet
more
guys
when
i
asked
him
i
tried
other
organizations
but
remembered
what
i
liked
to
do
in
high
school
drink
plus
a
lot
of
my
friends
from
my
hometown
are
wealthy
and
i
already
had
a
frat
wardrobe
so
i
thought
id
fit
in
they
are
both
awesome
people
that
i
love
to
hang
out
with
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
so
damn
embarrassed
that
this
is
truly
what
drew
them
into
greek
life
i
considered
rushing
and
if
i
did
i
would
have
done
it
for
the
sisterhood
philanthropy
and
impact
you
can
leave
on
the
community
instead
i
found
other
cheaper
clubs
to
do
that
in
they
seriously
want
to
dish
out
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
dressed
up
and
plastered
its
so
sad
how
someone
can
have
such
a
superficial
outlook
and
goals
on
their
only
college
experience
do
you
think
they
know
how
fucking
ridiculous
they
sound
so
they
dont
know
each
other
yet
but
now
im
starting
to
think
they
would
be
a
perfect
match

is
it
possible
to
be
in

that
i'm
knocking
it

threesome
porn
and
hopefully
one
day
it'll
come
knocking
on
my
door
it
would
make
my
life
to
wake
up
to
the
sound
of
two
hot
women
fighting
over
my
morning
wood
kendall
library
finally
figured
out
the
printer
wasnt
charging
you
and
i'm
really
mad
had
free
printing
for
a
solid
year
and
thought
it
was
a
great
little
secret
only
a
small
group
of
colsa
people
knew
since
we're
the
only
ones
that
use
that
library
its
so
close
to
the
end
of
the
year
couldnt
they
just
let
it
slide
man
it
smells
like
the
bottom
of
a
swimming
pool
in
here
you
don't
know
what
that
smells
like
swim
to
the
bottom
and
take
a
good
deep
breath
naturalselection
is
it
bad
that
i
totally
want
to
have
sex
with
one
of
my
best
friends
sister
there's
a
girl
in
my
hall
who
doesn't
wash
her
hands
after
she
goes
to
the
bathroom
why
it
takes
a
minute
tops
seriously
how
is
your
time
so
precious
that
a
minute
washing
your
hands
is
considered
wasted
or
is
there
a
different
reason
are
you
just
so
lazy
that
washing
your
hands
is
a
chore
do
you
have
painful
childhood
flashbacks
of
your
parents
making
you
wash
your
hands
before
dinner
does
the
thought
of
water
and
soap
touching
your
skin
freak
you
out
but
then
you
pee
and
go
off
no
matter
if
someone
is
watching
you
or
not
and
touch
the
door
handle
and
the
water
fountain
and
any
number
of
other
things
that
other
people
touch
and
it's
disgusting
i
know
piss
is
sterile
but
that
doesn't
mean
i
want
to
touch
yours

at
least

why
are
you
so
hot
and
cold
seriously
thought
it
was
all
gonna
be
okay
you
are
the
greatest
for
a
week
and
then
it's
back
to
the
bullshit
if
i
was
advising
a
friend
in
my
situation
i'd
say
to
end
it
but
it's
harder
when
it's
you
2
halloweens
ago
i
was
dressed
up
as
bane
i
got
fucked
up
and
jacked
a
fire
extinguisher
from
parking
garage
i
carried
it
with
me
behind
northgate
while
i
tried
to
find
transportation
that
would
get
me
home
i
found
one
ugy
candidate
that
wasn't
chained
up
an
old
80
s
era
cycling
bike
this
neglected
dinosaur
was
the
only
bike
out
of
"50,000"
that
wasn't
chained
up
trust
me
i
checked
i
hoped
on
positioned
the
fire
extinguisher
under
arm
and
began
wobbling
down
the
road
as
i
began
going
down
college
main
down
the
hill
away
from
ngate
i
realized
i
had
no
breaks
they
were
cut
n
broken
so
i
was
riding
this
chariot
straight
to
hell
as
i
began
picking
up
speed
there
was
a
lil
bonfire
yard
party
out
front
of
a
house
to
the
left
as
i'm
passing
i
hear
hey
todd
isn't
that
your
bike
i'm
like
nigga
this
ain't
todd's
bike
and
i
continue
thinking
nothing
of
it
well
suddenly
i
realize
a
ninja
is
running
along
the
little
stone
wall
next
to
the
path
and
it's
clear
he
is
on
a
mission
motherfucker
jumps
infront
of
the
bike
and
grabs
on
to
handlebars
and
i
flip
and
all
i
can
think
about
is
a
who
the
fuck
is
todd
b
why
does
he
love
this
bike
soo
much
c.damn
that
fire
extinguisher
makes
a
lot
of
fuckin
racquet
when
it's
launched
from
a
bike
onto
the
pavement
d
is
todd
kenyan
cuz
daaaam
as
i'm
getting
off
the
pavement
a
chubby
girl
in
cat
make
up
is
standing
right
there
whining
and
asking
why
i
took
todd's
bike
i
am
just
flabbergasted
that
garfield
could
cover
40
yards
that
fast
next
thing
i
know
todd's
people
are
surrounding
me
talkin
shit
askin
why
i
took
bike
then
todd
shoves
me
and
says
why'd
u
take
it
at
that
point
i
realize
i
am
going
to
get
gang
raped
by
todd
n
his
cronies
unless
i
can
create
a
diversion
engage
operation
shock
and
awe
i
pickup
extinguisher
and
swing
that
bitch
right
into
side
of
todd's
knee
and
todd
goes
down
ko
bitches
everyone
takes
a
step
back
n
sets
down
the
flames
n
pitch
forks
for
a
second
and
i
shoulder
the
extinguisher
and
say
i'm
just
trying
to
find
hometree
and
book
it
through
the
woods
thus
ends
one
of
the
many
tales
of
the
chupacabra
my
boyfriend
is
abusive
to
me
we
have
been
through
a
really
hard
year
i
stay
with
him
thinking
that
he
will
change
but
every
time
i
really
need
him
i
feel
like
he
doesn't
care
everything
is
all
about
how
upset
he
is
all
the
time
he
has
lead
me
to
cut
myself
once
even
and
he
didn't
even
really
seem
to
care
that
much
tonight
he
tried
to
choke
me
and
then
hit
me
in
the
leg
and
left
me
all
alone
at
my
house
he
didn't
care
didn't
even
text
me
he
yells
at
me
for
ever
feeling
insecure
but
i
have
gone
through
a
lot
in
this
past
year
including
him
beating
me
and
telling
me
i'm
worthless
and
then
apologizing
later
what
do
i
do
if
i
ever
feel
like
leaving
him
i
know
he
will
try
and
kill
himself
i
know
the
real
him
is
somewhere
deep
down
inside
of
him
because
the
real
him
never
treated
me
this
way
before
the
real
him
would
see
i
was
upset
and
treat
me
like
he
cares
while
the
new
him
gets
this
monotone
voice
like
he's
bored
and
can't
even
look
at
me
if
i
am
upset
i
think
he
feels
guilty
for
how
much
pain
he
caused
me
how
can
i
make
him
see
what
he
is
doing
to
me
by
not
being
emotionally
present
for
me
and
by
abusing
me
i
just
want
him
to
seek
help
for
his
problems
so
that
we
can
fix
ours
vaginas
are
supposedly
self
cleaning
organs
right
so
isn't
that
just
proof
that

i
know
you
had

bad
ex
girlfriend
and
all
that
and
that
you
don't
want
anything
serious
however
i
think
you're
stupid
in
thinking
that
i
want
something
serious
too
all
i
want
is
for
you
to
acknowledge
the
feelings
and
the
attraction
we
have
for
one
another
who
says
we
have
to
date
let's
just
try
us
out
and
go
from
there
you
tried
to
try
us
out
in
the
beginning
but
i
think
you
got
scared
of
your
feelings
for
me
don't
be
scared
things
only
have
to
be
as
serious
as
we
want
them
to
be

my
confidence
is
one
of
my
favorite
qualities
however
it
makes
me
a
huge
perfectionist
if
i
am
not
perfect
than
there's
nothing
to
be
confident
about
i
put
so
much
pressure
on
myself
to
be
perfect
and
it
makes
me
so
stressed
and
tense
at
times
i
am
worried
that
i
will
lose
confidence
at
cornell
and
exams
will
just
make
me
go
crazy
anyone
have
advice
on
how
to
relax
and
not
freak
out
during
stressful
times
at
cornell
thanks
in
advance

failed
a
class
how
bad
does
it
look
on
my
transcript
to
have
failed
a
class
my
last
semester
17725
i've
tried
lots
of
things
with
respect
to
finding
a
new
girlfriend
i've
spontaneously
talked
to
girls
and
later
asked
them
on
dates
my
friends
have
tried
to
set
me
up
i've
changed
my
attitudes
i've
become
more
disciplined
and
outgoing
i
go
to
the
gym
5
days
a
week
for
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
and
nothing
seems
to
catch
my
eye
ear
nose
vestibular
sense
touch
or
any
other
sense
for
that
matter
am
i
a
prude
am
i
unattractive
am
i
boring
do
i
have
resting
asshole
face
i've
already
gone
through
this
after
breaking
up
with
the
same
girl
once
we
got
back
together
out
of
loneliness
and
desperation
now
it's
over
again
and
for
the
same
good
reasons
i
don't
want
that
to
happen
again
i
have
never
felt
that
burning
passion
for
anyone
other
than
this
one
girlfriend
i
have
had
twice
on
and
once
off
over
the
course
of
4.5
years
i
treated
her
like
a
queen
and
always
put
her
first
when
i
could
i
catered
to
her
vegetarianism
and
her
strange
diet
i
put
in
so
much
more
effort
into
the
relationship
than
she
did
i
made
sculptures
and
sh
t
who
the
f
ck
gets
to
say
my
boyfriend
made
me
a
sculpture
for
my
birthday
i
didn't
even
manage
to
hook
up
with
anyone
for
the
year
we
were
apart
no
one
makes
me
feel
that
beautiful
way
here
when
i
get
anywhere
close
to
the
butterflies
and
the
overwhelmed
with
cuteness
feeling
it
gets
shot
down
sometimes
hours
sometimes
days
later
so
many
potential
beginnings
end
in
yeah
no
i
want
to
feel
romance
and
passion
again
i
want
to
feel
loved
on
a
partner
level
i'm
also
horny
as
all
f
ck
did
i
mention
i
gave
this
girl
multiple
orgasms
on
a
regular
basis
did
i
mention
that
i've
given
this
girl
synesthesia
during
her
orgasms
i
know
every
girl
is
different
but
that
must
count
for
something
how
the
f
ck
am
i
still
single
you
girls
have
no
f
cking
clue
what
you're
missing
out
on
i
attract
the
wrong
kinds
of
guys
ugh
where
are
the
white
single
non
drug
user
guys
ugh
aggravated
white
girl
2187
co
worker
it's
disgusting
how
much
it's
expanding
it's
like
nyu
is
making
it
its
business
to
spread
all
that
homosexuality
don't
they
realize
the
repercussions
me
yeah
your
son's
boyfriend
also
realizes
the
repercussions
i
had
a
class
with
him
last
semester
i
failed
my
biology
test
then
when
my
professor
asked
me
if
i
ever
visited
the
math
skills
center
i
was
like
but
isn't
that
for
math
this
is
a
bio
class
i
mean
you
could
easily
understand
how
i'd
get
confused
am
i
right
or
am
i
right
so
i'm
a
girl
and
i've
come
to
the
realization
that
i
may
be
friend
zoned
now
i
know
most
guys
say
girls
are
never
friend
zoned
but
this
guy
knows
how
i
feel
and
has
said
at
points
that
he
has
feelings
for
me
but
nothing
has
happened
when
it
comes
to
a
relationship
we
game
and
hang
out
like
all
the
time
and
it's
not
like
things
are
platonic
or
anything
it's
been
this
way
for
a
few
months
now
i'm
just
not
too
sure
what
to
do
at
this
point
i
really
care
for
this
guy
and
he
so
similar
it's
stupid
any
advice
is
it
normal
to
never
believe
compliments
i
always
think
people
are
lying
and
that
they're
just
being
nice
because
they
feel
sorry
for
me
sometimes
the
nicer
people
are
the
more
it
feels
like
i'm
being
mocked
so
any
lovely
ladies
wanna
take
part
in
the
sci
li
challenge
with
me
and
i'm
not
talking
about
taking
shots
what
the
actual
fuck
why
hasn't
unh
crushes
been
updated
it's
been
over
a
week
i
can't
be
the
only
one
who's
addicted
to
reading
crushes
and
confessions

i
don't
like
the
idea
of
coming
out
and
declaring
that
one
is
not
heterosexual
i
feel
as
if
it
reinforces
the
idea
that
the
community
of
the
person
coming
out
if
not
the
community
as
a
whole
world
is
heteronormative
do
i
get
9000
brown
points
now
for
using
this
word
coming
out
implies
that
we
expect
each
other
to
all
be
heterosexuals
and
that
a
public
oral
written
declaration
is
necessary
to
announce
that
a
person
is
not
why
can't
we
just
assume
that
people
will
love
and
like
whomever
they
wish
how
do
you
unsubscribe
from
certain
emails
and
list
serves
stalking
is
a
disease
and
cc
is
an
environment
that
it
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
former
stalkers
like
myself
to
recover
is
anyone
else
interested
in
starting

how
do
i
know
if
my
boyfriend
is
the
one
that
doesn't
love
his
girlfriend
anymore
and
is
too
afraid
to
say
the
thing
that
is
depleting
in
this
world
is
purity
and
innocence
why
can't
people
talk
about
the
patterns
of
clouds
in
the
sky
or
smile
seeing
a
child
running
around
why
is
it
always
looking
in
your
phone
replying
to
facebook
or
snapchat
why
does
everything
have
to
be
something
related
to
sex
or
badass
things
why
are
people
so
desperately
in
search
of
a
partner
or
a
friend
while
they
can't
be
happy
by
themselves
first
why
does
it
always
have
to
be
football
or
basketball
why
can't
it
be
about
playing
in
the
mud
or
splashing
in
the
puddle
why
don't
girls
believe
that
they
are
princesses
anymore
by
princesses
i
don't
mean
being
rich
or
beautiful
just
being
someone
that
makes
yourself
happy
why
does
it
always
have
to
be
clubs
and
drinking
why
can't
it
be
laying
on
the
grass
and
falling
asleep
looking
at
the
stars
this
all
sounds
crazy
but
that's
how
i
remember
my
childhood
i
am
not
the
same
as
i
was
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
am
not
trying
to
be
but
i
have
that
sense
of
innocence
somewhere
in
me
which
when
comes
out
becomes
an
object
of
scorn
and
laughter
it
doesn't
bother
me
because
i
cannot
do
anything
about
that
but
i
just
wish
that
people
would
behave
as
they
like
to
and
not
as
they
think
the
world
wants
them
to
p.s
thank
you
merrick
but

sharing
a

how
do

go
about
reporting
a

without
it
affecting
my

preferably
anonymous
yet
s
he
still
experiences
consequences
for
their
actions
take
it
from
someone
who
knows
when
your
moment
comes
do
not
back
down
when
the
opportunity
of
your
lifetime
comes
along
you
better
seize
it
when
it's
all
on
the
line
and
it's
your
time
hold
nothing
back
when
the
climactic
defining
moment
of
your
life
is
at
hand
you
cannot
falter
you
cannot
doubt
yourself
or
your
abilities
and
most
importantly
you
cannot
hesitate
believe
in
yourself
and
believe
you
will
succeed
nay
triumph
otherwise
you'll
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
looking
back
and
wondering
what
if
i
hadn't
hesitated
what
if
my
resolve
had
been
firmer
would
things
have
played
out
differently
would
i
be
a
champion
in
a
whole
other

would
i

failure

and
her
boyfriend
whaaaaiiii
so
i'm
trying
to
meet
up
with
girls
that
are
complete
strangers
to
have
fun
with
in
a
public
place
anyone
on
this
page
down
for
a
little
action
from
a
total
stranger
like
this
post
and
i
will
message
you
admin
edit
ladies
this
is
how
you
end
up
starring
in
the
first

attention
cornellians
the
3rd
and
4th
floors
of
mann
library
are
not
for
people
who
want
to
talk
to
each
other
yes
the
entire
row
of
tables
can
hear
you
even
if
you
think
you're
whispering
seriously
guys
i
don't
understand
the
lack
of
courtesy
i
thought
you
came
to
the
library
because
you
wanted
to
study
16547
im
always
the
girl
that
you
will
go
to
to
ask
about
your
girl
problems
i
guess
i
have
that
easy
going
and
animated
quality
i
talk
a
lot
so
people
around
me
just
feel
comfortable
doing
the
same
but
is
it
too
much
to
ask
to
actually
start
a
relationship
ive
talked
to
my
best
guy
friends
more
than
they
talk
to
their
actual
girlfriends
what's
wrong
with
me
i
dont
want
hook
ups
i
want
someone
i
like
to
really
look
at
me
and
see
someone
they
want
to
be
with
more
than
a
friend
2495
i
love
my
girlfriend
so
much
i'm
planning
on
marrying
her
but
every
weekend
this
one
slut
isabel
wont
stop
trying
to
to
hook
up
with
me
please
just
stop
i
don't
want
to
cheat
on
my
girlfriend
but
don't
you
have
a
boyfriend
that
goes
here
too
don't
do
that
to
him
he's
way
too
good
of
a
kid
can
someone
please
explain
the
logic
behind
a
guy
who
has
a
girlfriend
texting
a
girl
he
used
to
hook
up
with
in
a
chit
chatty
way
but
never
asking
to
hang
out
or
anything
what's
the
point
what's
he
gaining
from
this
interaction
i
have
seen
worlds
bathed
in
the
makers
flames
their
denizens
fading
without
so
much
as
a
whimper
entire
planetary
systems
born
and
raised
in
the
time
that
it
takes
your
mortal
hearts
to
beat
once
yet
all
throughout
my
own
heart
devoid
of
emotion
of
empathy
i
have
felt
nothing
a
million
million
lives
wasted
had
they
all
held
within
them
your
tenacity
had
they
all
loved
life
as
you
do
perhaps
it
is
your
imperfection
that
which
grants
you
free
will
that
allows
you
to
persevere
against
cosmically
calculated
odds

i'm
struggling
to
keep
my
virginity
when
my
boyfriend
and
i
do
things
i
feel
so
much
passionate
and
the
deepest
connection
i've
never
felt
this
way
for
anyone
before
we
are
in
love
and
i
know
we
will
last
post
college
he
doesn't
force
me
to
do
anything
and
i
feel
disgusting
that
i
am
the
one
who
wants
to
do
more
why
is
it
so
wrong
that
i
want
to
give
fully
give
myself
to
him
how
is
it
possible
that
i
the
stereotyped
goodie
two
shoes
church
girl
am
contemplating
these
thoughts
i
grew
up
in
such
a
religious
household
that
this
issue
has
overwhelmed
me
with
shame
i
fear
disappointing
my
parents
church
and
community
this
may
sound
trivial
to
most
but
i
constantly
cry
myself
to
sleep
and
pray
that
i
won't
be
condemned
i
need
help
i
don't
know
how
i
would
cope
should
i
actually
give
in
to
my
longings
i
need
someone
to
talk
to
i
feel
so
alone
looking
at
the
confessions
here
it
makes
think
wtf
most
girls
are
sluts
i
hope
i
don't
end
up
with
someone
like
that
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
loyal
trustworthy
girls
but
based
on
these
confessions
they
are
hard
to
find
when
gay
dudes
have
a
crush
on
straight
guys
do
they
fantasize
about
giving
him
a
beej
or
doing
him
doggy
style
it
seems
like
the
straight
friend
might
be
more
open
to
one
of
those
choices
than
the
other
8700
i
am
the
guy
that
saw
the
blonde
can
i
have
8700
i
just
wanted
to
thank
all
of
you
for
staying
up
and
watching
this
this
is
cool
and
i'm
excited
she
just
turned
her
lights
off
by
the
way
i
don't
mean
to
creep
but
what
would
you
do
she
really
is
gorgeous
people
you
don't
understand
i
appreciate
all
of
your
help
cornell
is
awesome
are
there
any
other
guys
here
who
life
black
girls
but
don't
know
how
to
go
about
it
any
tips
on
how
to
get
with
one
74
there
is
this
girl
i
have
been
friends
with
for
a
while
she
is
smart
funny
and
fun
to
be
around
i
love
just
chilling
with
her
and
talking
smack
my
problem
is
that
i
have
recently
developed
feelings
for
her
and
i
don't
want
to
jeopardize
our
friendship
and
tell
her
because
i
couldn't
stand
the
possibility
of
loosing
her
as
a
friend
i
don't
even
know
if
she
likes
me
as
an
friend
because
she
is
so
hard
to
read
if
i
have
to
suppress
my
feelings
so
be
it
can't
a
guy
and
a
girl
just
be
friends
why
is
this
happening
to
me
how
do
i
stop
this
can
you
get
a
guy
to
appreciate
you
more
i
know
my
boyfriend
loves
me
but
sometimes
i
just
want
him
to
surprise
me
with
romantic
things
to
show
he
does
like
the
saying
goes
actions
speak
louder
than
words
and
honestly
i
feel
like
if
he
doesn't
eventually
a
guy
will
come
around
who
does
and
i
will
end
up
leaving
him
even
though
i
truly
do
love
my
boyfriend
4966
can
we
all
just
agree
that
steven
wartinbee
is
a
pretentious
douche
has
anyone
seen
the
black
and
white
cat
that
wanders
around
campus
recently
i
haven't
and
i'm
worried
about
him

how
do
so
many
european
girls
achieve
that
model
status
height
weight
ratio
is
is
genetics
or
do
they
starve
themselves
i
believe
the
internet
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
people
are
turning
away
from
religion
the
way
it
connects
the
world
and
shares
information
with
a
click
of
a
button
is
awesome
but
when
some
atheist
busts
out
a
logically
sound
argument
how
there
is
no
god
it
makes
weak
minded
12
year
olds
who
spend
their
whole
days
on
computers
question
their
beliefs
if
they
had
any
in
the
first
place
then
they
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
preaching
what
they
believe
converting
people
to
what
they
see
as
the
truth
and
i
know
not
all
atheists
do
this
and
i
know
that
this
is
the
whole
basis
of
christianity
but
why
shove
what
you
think
is
right
down
people's
throats
hell
i'll
admit
i've
questioned
my
faith
a
couple
of
times
due
to
a
logically
sound
statement
that
i've
seen
on
the
internet
before
i
even
believe
in
evolution
and
the
big
bang
it
just
makes
sense
but
the
fact
remains
is
that
life
is
beautiful
and
the
way
the
universe
functions
in
such
harmony
i
truly
believe
there
has
to
be
a
higher
power
force
of
nature
that
enabled
me
to
do
this
call
him
her
it
god
or
whatever
you
choose
i
think
we
can
all
agree
on
that
when
i
finished
typing
this
i
realized
i
strayed
completely
off
topic
my
bad
tl
dr
i
believe
the
internet
is
making
people
turn
away
from
religion
and
this
upsets
me
but
then
again
it
doesn't
any
other
aggies
play
war
thunder
i'm
getting
kind
of
tired
of
playing
alone
find
a
nice
guy
don't
friend
zone
him
end
zone
him
and
throw
him
on
the
ground
like
freaking
football
touchdown
the
nice
guy
finally
scores
i
have
a
steady
sex
partner
i've
never
given
a
blowjob
before
how
do
i
start
6338
to
those
in
long
term
relationships
don't
you
get
bored
of
your
partner
like
the
hooking
up
style
is
the
same
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
be
spontaneous
it
will
still
be
more
or
less
the
same
so
don't
you
get
bored
how
do
you
stay
in
something
for
so
long
i'm
scared
to
get
myself
involved
a
guy
falls
in
love
with
a
very
traditional
and
conservative
girl
that
means
no
sex
before
marriage
but
he
doesn't
care
he
loves
her
after
a
year
or
two
of
dating
he
decides
its
time
to
propose
so
he
heads
to
her
fathers
house
to
ask
his
permission
hello
sir
i'm
here
to
ask
for
your
daughter's
hand
a
bit
skeptical
and
looking
to
see
if
he
really
does
love
her
the
father
asks
and
why
is
that
the
guy
lets
out
a
long
drawn
out
sigh
well
its
just
that
mine
have
gotten
tired
my
theory
is
that
women
can
only
pair
bond
to
one
male
at
a
time
and
that
is
what
makes
them
seem
like
a
good
woman
or
basically
its
the
pair
bond
that
causes
her
to
engage
in
a
heightened
display
of
positive
qualities
she
does
not
show
to
others
once
she
has
sex
with
another
male
she
begins
to
release
oxytocin
and
associate
it
with
him
and
thus
starts
to
form
a
bond
with
this
other
man
compound
this
with
the
problem
she
is
no
longer
associating
oxytocin
releases
with
her
husband
as
they're
no
longer
having
sex
and
you
have
a
woman
who
is
no
longer
pair
bonded
or
in
love
with
her
husband
but
has
indeed
checked
out
and
is
now
bonding
with
a
completely
different
man
despite
for
all
appearances
being
married
to
her
soon
to
be
ex
once
they
branch
swing
or
have
already
undergone
lengthy
preparations
to
ensure
the
branch
swing
is
successful
as
it
appears
this
woman
is
doing
the
pair
bond
is
broken
in
fact
the
pair
bond
is
long
broken
before
she
actually
commits
to
the
branch
swing
the
pair
bond
was
destroyed
the
very
moment
she
started
enjoying
regular
sex
with
another
man
that
is
not
just
her
body
enjoying
such
an
arrangement
but
her
mind
too
whilst
pair
bonded
to
you
a
woman
is
a
completely
different
person
than
from
when
she
is
not
pair
bonded
to
you
the
cold
indifference
is
a
stark
contrast
from
the
loving
woman
of
perhaps
a
month
or
two
prior
it's
the
difference
between
her
relationship
with
you
in
a
pair
bonded
and
a
non
pair
bonded
state
i
think
many
many
men
can
relate
to
this
behaviour
from
their
own
experiences
many
men
have
noted
how
easily
women
seem
to
move
on
and
how
effortlessly
they
branch
swing
even
after
long
long
relationships
lasting
years
they
seem
to
have
this
ability
to
easily
find
meaningful
relationships
elsewhere
whereas
a
man
who
had
a
long
relationship
with
a
woman
typically
does
not
find
it
so
easy
to
just
replace
his
wife
out
of
the
blue
because
things
got
boring
add
a
mistress
to
the
rotation
sure
but
he's
still
there
for
his
wife
and
he's
still
willing
to
fuck
her
men
don't
just
stop
loving
you
because
you
don't
make
them
tingle
anymore
unlike
women
men
stop
loving
you
when
you
stop
displaying
femininity
towards
them
it's
as
if
women
are
programmed
only
to
respect
and
respond
well
to
the
man
fucking
them
the
best
if
a
woman
runs
a
harem
of
men
she'll
love
whoever
fucks
her
the
best
despite
who
her
husband
is
meant
to
be
if
a
man
runs
a
harem
he's
still
capable
of
loving
his
wife
despite
all
the
side
pussy
he's
getting
he
doesn't
think
oh
shit
this
airheads
pussy
is
so
nice
i'm
going
to
leave
my
wife
over
it
cheating
on
your
partner
seems
to
affect
the
genders
differently
i
would
love
for
them
to
do
studies
on
this
shit
backup

conjecture
of
my
observations
with

upcoming
after
bombing
several
classes
this
semester
my
parents
decided
to
cut
off
financial
support
for
me
and
i
now
feel
a
sense
of
freedom
and
empowerment
am
i
deceiving
myself
oh
your
face
is
flawless
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
put
on
make
up
to
cover
up
my
acne
at
least
my
body
is
attractive
unlike
your
fat
self
you
don't
hear
me
talking
about
my
small
waist
when
your
touching
your
layers
of
fat
do
you
no
cuz
i
don't
judge
people
based
on
their
appearance
or
make
them
feel
bad
about
it
so
go
shove
your
rude
unnecessary
comment
up
your
fat
ass
i
have
class
and
recitation
with
a
good
friend
of
mine
but
i
don't
think
he
knows
that
i
can
see
him
cheating
on
the
quizzes
every
week
with
his
phone
between
his
legs
it's
made
me
really
start
to
distance
myself
from
him
because
i
thought
he
was
someone
different
and
better
than
that
i
just
don't
really
know
what
i
should
say
when
he
asks
why
we
haven't
hung
out
if
i
tell
the
ta
he
could
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
and
i
don't
want
that
but
at
the
same
time
i
really
want
him
to
stop
is
it
weird
that
i
care
hi
i
don't
know
how
this
works
but
i
have
no
one
else
to
tell
but
you
i'm
a
good
guy
that
nice
guy
that
always
gave
my
girlfriend
everything
i
could
to
see
her
happy
when
she
was
sick
i'd
run
to
philly
and
get
her
chicken
noodle
soup
id
run
to
her
class
to
give
her
an
umbrella
if
it
was
pouring
too
i
waited
for
her
outside
her
class
on
our
anniversaries
with
flowers
i
lit
candles
in
dorm
for
a
romantic
dinners
don't
worry
no
fire
alarms
went
off
there
wasn't
a
doubt
that
we
were
happy
together
but
since
i
left
this
guy
has
had
a
crush
on
her
he
consistently
hits
on
her
and
tries
wicked
hard
to
get
with
her
even
though
he
knew
me
and
he
knew
we
have
been
together
for
a
few
years
maybe
i
should
have
stayed
because
when
i
had
to
leave
unh
he
began
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
i
was
no
longer
there
i
just
don't
know
how
someone
could
just
step
into
someone
else's
relationship
so
easily
and
pursue
someone
that
already
has
someone
special
my
fellow
wildcats
if
someone
has
a
significant
other
please
respect
that
you
don't
know
how
hard
they
worked
to
be
together
have
fun
but
don't
lose
the
people
that
really
matter
rice
kids
complain
too
damn
much
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
world
you
have
a
pretty
good
life
most
of
us
will
go
on
to
get
really
good
jobs
and
live
really
good
lives
we
are
attending
a
very
prestigious
university
and
are
offered
opportunities
that
most
would
sacrifice
everything
for
you
complain
that
you're
not
happy
at
rice
because
you
don't
have
friends
there
are
people
out
there
with
no
families
due
to
hate
crimes
and
civil
war
you
complain
about
homework
some
people
can't
go
to
college
because
they
can't
even
afford
it
on
loans
hate
the
servery
food
there
are
children
everywhere
who
would
be
happy
to
have
what
you
eat
in
a
meal
for
a
week
there
are
people
starving
to
death
being
murdered
and
just
having
all
around
worse
lives
than
your
over
dramatic
ass
the
next
time
you're
sad
because
no
one
wants
to
hug
you
think
about
the
child
who
doesn't
even
have
arms
anymore
to
give
hugs
if
you're
sad
get
some
help
if
you're
too
afraid
or
embarrassed
to
get
help
maybe
you
don't
actually
need
it
and
you
need
to
re
evaluate
your
priorities
in
life
don't
apologize
for
the
opportunities
you
were
given
and
where
you
came
from
but
at
the
same
time
don't
take
them
for
granted
and
waste
your
talents

turn
around

go
through
it
twice
because
i'm

confusion
reigns
you
mean
so
much
to
me
but
i
feel
like
i
cant
do
anything
right
when
im
around
you
you
are
a
totally
different
person
in
some
circumstances
than
you
are
in
others
i
have
no
idea
whether
i
should
keep
trying
to
reach
out
to
you
or
back
off
and
give
you
space
honestly
i
have
become
incapacitated
from
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
are
really
thinking
and
feeling
for
so
long
thats
why
im
such
a
mess

i
didn't
study
for
my
final
yesterday
scored
better
than
i
did
on
all
my
prelims
which
i
studied
hours
for
what
3446
i
just
skyped
with
my
dog
to
say
goodbye
before
my
parents
put
her
down
i
want
to
cry
because
she's
my
best
friend
but
i'm
not
crying
and
that's
terrifying
me
what's
wrong
with
me
i
just
lost
my
best
friend
and
i
can't
cry
what
do
white
guys
think
of
hispanic
girls
i
feel
as
though
they
just
look
right
past
us
as
a
girl
from
the
country
i
personally
have
never
dated
a
guy
who
isn't
white
but
it
seems
harder
to
get
a
guys
attention
here
hmm
here's
an
idea
instead
of
yelling
at
me
because
i
have
a
cord
dragged
along
the
floor
due
to
limited
outlets
in
the
library
how
about
you
add
a
shit
ton
more
outlets
i
pay
a
decent
amount
of
money
and
dimond
library
and
the
mub
need
more
outlets

to

was

fucking
freshmen
right
only
a
freshman
would
be
so
stupid
as
to
defecate
in
his
own
bed
but
on
this
lucky
occasion
he
wasn't
the
only
one
in
that
bed
it
was
four
years
ago
and
i
was
a
young
and
upcoming
frat
star
and
by
frat
star
i
mean
a
bottom
feeding
pledge
from
pike
as
most
of
y'all
know
pike
is
the
best
fucking
frat
in
the
nation
and
crushes
more
ass
than
a
snow
cone
machine
crushes
ice
i
was
doing
everything
in
my
power
to
prove
to
my
brothers
that
i
belonged
it
all
started
on
an
early
friday
morning
when
a
couple
of
pledges
decided
it
would
be
a
fantastic
idea
to
pre
game
for
the
infamous
pikes
of
the
caribbean
at
this
time
i
was
unaware
of
exactly
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
all
i
had
heard
was
that
there
were
three
girls
to
every
one
guy
and
that
not
taking
at
least
one
if
not
multiple
girls
to
pound
town
would
immediately
get
any
pledge
balled
out
as
you
might
imagine
slaying
at
this
party
was
as
simple
as
convincing
a
gator
that
they
are
good
at
sports
as
the
girls
rolled
in
i
knew
i
would
start
off
easy
a
simple
gamma
phi
would
do
just
fine
they
swarmed
like
flies
around
a
night
light
and
eventually
the
slaying
began
however
shortly
after
the
second
sorostitute
fell
by
the
wayside
my
sobriety
also
was
well
beyond
reach
it
was
about
this
time
that
everything
turned
black
and
while
the
party
raged
on
including
myself
my
consciousness
was
completely
fucked
i
couldn't
remember
a
thing
low
and
behold
the
next
morning
i
woke
up
next
to
a
dime
piece
dg
but
was
completely
panicked
what
awoke
me
was
the
horrendous
odor
that
seemed
to
be
caked
to
my
body
as
i
looked
down
i
noticed
this
brown
sludge
caked
to
my
ass
and
legs
turns
out
i
had
been
so
inebriated
that
i
had
shat
this
dg's
bed
clearly
i
did
the
only
thing
possible
i
grabbed
some
shit
and
gently
rubbed
it
on
her
ass
making
it
appear
that
she
had
been
the
one
to
shit
the
bed
after
brilliantly
covering
my
trails
i
hightailed
it
out
of
her
apartment
doing
my
absolute
best
not
to
puke
on
my
way
out
i
have
come
a
long
way
since
freshmen
year
but
hopefully
i
will
never
outgrow
soiling
sorostitutes
beds
luhhhhh
fsu
why
are
all
the
will
rice
freshmen
a
bunch
of
tools
goddamn
it
ok
not
all
some
o
week
hurts
at
duncan
they
gave
someone
an
alternate
spot
who
didn't
even
show
up
for
the
interview
76
people
had
a
chance
to
interview
you
don't
even
show
up
and
you
get
a
spot
that's
not
what
rice
is
about
makes
me
sad
our
new
students
get
to
see
first
hand
you
don't
even
have
to
show
up
to
get
things
here
i
always
wonder
if
people
think
and
feel
as
much
as
i
do
sometimes
it's
so
overwhelming
that
i
feel
crazy
everyone
around
me
seems
so
nonchalant
and
carefree
and
even
though
nothing
is
wrong
in
my
life
i
am
constantly
battling
what
feels
like
a
complete
hurricane
of
thoughts
violently
thrashing
in
my
mind
they're
so
all
over
the
place
that
i
can't
even
make
sense
of
them
do
most
people
think
like
this
and
just
not
say
anything

today
when
i
got
home
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
sit
on
the
toilet
seat
for
10
minutes
no
i
was
not
using
the
bathroom
i
was
just
sitting
on
the
toilet
why
you
may
ask
for
the
past
4
months
or
so
my
roommates
and
i
have
been
living
in
an
apartment
with
a
tiny
ass
bathroom
the
toilet
is
really
small
and
right
next
to
the
shower
so
there's
isn't
much
room
to
spread
your
legs
now
this
is
fine
for
my
in
shape
slim
roommates
but
for
my
big
fat
ass
i
cannot
pretend
it
wasn't
a
bit
of
a
struggle
at
times
i
had
to
wiggle
squirm
stretch
squeeze
and
essentially
do
anything
in
my
power
to
make
the
toilet
work
for
me
this
often
involved
using
the
toilet
with
one
leg
in
the
bath
tub
thus
getting
my
right
sock
all
wet
the
bathroom
also
got
really
hot
in
the
summer
and
really
cold
in
the
winter
so
i
would
often
find
myself
either
sweating
profusely
or
shivering
while
handling
the
most
holy
of
businesses
so
when
i
got
home
and
sat
on
my
nice
normal
sized
toilet
enjoying
the
angle
at
which
i
could
now
spread
my
legs
and
the
tepid
temperature
of
my
home
i
sighed
and
i
realized
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
2621
i'm
currently
abroad
right
now
and
even
the
mere
thought
of
going
back
to
l
c
makes
me
feel
like
sobbing
i'd
transfer
but
there's
not
enough
time
how
can
a
place
so
far
away
still
feel
so
claustrophobic
i'm
really
sick
of
people
in
relationships
telling
me
to
just
enjoy
being
single
if
it's
so
great
why
the
hell
are
you
dating
someone
4572
when
people
ask
me
why
i
don't
drink
they
throw
out
a
variety
of
options
is
it
a
religious
reason
is
it
a
legal
reason
are
you
uncomfortable
in
those
kinds
of
settings
to
these
people
i'd
like
to
say
did
you
ever
consider
that
maybe
i
value
the
fact
that
my
parents
slaved
away
to
give
me
an
opportunity
that
they
never
could
have
dreamed
of
and
i'm
not
about
to
throw
that
away
for
a
few
nights
of
drunken
fun
you
do
what
you
want
i've
never
asked
you
why
you
drink
so
stop
judging
me
for
my
decision
2736
why
the
fuck
is
it
called
the
walk
of
shame
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
night
ain't
no
shame
in
my
game

any
other

i'm

but
i
can

i'm
terrified
by
the
idea
of
shaving
my
balls
how
do
you
pass
the
razor
over
without
nicking
the
sack
so
like
do
you
need
a
date
for
this
valentine's
day
dance
12023
so
many
of
the
posts
on
cornell
confessions
make
me
want
to
throw
up
at
how
stupid
cornellians
sound
i
think
this
school
and
our
society
american
culture
has
been
plummeting
in
social
emotional
and
intellectual
intelligence
to
the
point
that
i
wonder
how
i'm
going
to
ever
survive
in
the
real
world
if
this
is
what
cornell
students
are
like
what
are
people
like
elsewhere
nevertheless
a
lot
of
the
posts
are
still
amusing
wait
does
alex
crotty
still
go
here
is
inviting
a
girl
to
the
symphony
a
good
date
idea
i
really
love
the
symphony
but
i
never
invite
girls
because
i
think
most
of
them
are
not
interested
in
classical
music
what
do
you
think
ladies
oh
irony
the
five
letter
word
that
is
the
expression
of
one's
meaning
by
using
language
that
normally
signifies
the
opposite
why
does
someone
you
find
gross
in
photos
appear
to
be
so
beautiful
in
reality
why
is
the
person
you
should
hate
because
they
have
wronged
you
time
and
time
again
is
in
reality
one
of
the
few
that
you
love
why
has
the
person
who
you
once
defined
as
your
best
friend
seem
to
disappoint
and
betray
you
over
and
over
again
these
are
all
questions
i
currently
find
myself
asking
as
i
presume
so
do
many
of
my
peers
and
these
are
questions
i
don't
and
never
will
know
the
answer
to
they
say
that
everything
happens
for
a
reason
well
let
me
tell
you
most
of
my
life
i've
had
a
hard
time
figuring
out
what
that
reason
may
be
i've
driven
myself
crazy
coming
up
with
dozens
of
scenarios
stories
upon
stories
but
for
what
nothing
the
truth
will
set
you
free
they
say
and
so
i've
gone
searching
for
the
truth
sure
most
of
it
has
been
internalized
truth
but
i've
also
reached
out
and
made
myself
extremely
vulnerable
for
many
truths
and
have
i
found
them
negative
unfortunately
people
are
too
afraid
of
the
truth
they
cannot
bring
themselves
to
tell
the
truth
because
they
cannot
face
the
truth
themselves
and
that's
what
gets
us
stuck
in
messes
like
these
anyway
maybe
if
i
had
told
him
i
loved
him
sooner
we
would
still
be
together
maybe
if
i
fought
harder
initially
even
though
i
was
afraid
this
wouldn't
have
happened
maybe
if
i
told
her
that
her
actions
have
hurt
me
that
she
has
been
a
terrible
friend
to
me
then
maybe
we
would
be
able
to
mend
our
friendship
she
bends
over
backwards
for
everyone
else
but
why
doesn't
she
bend
over
backwards
for
one
of
the
few
who
is
willing
to
do
so
for
her
there
are
some
things
in
life
we
are
not
meant
to
understand
some
questions
are
better
left
unanswered
and
that
my
friends
is
the
ironic
part
we
spend
our
lives
analyzing
the
what
ifs
and
whys
but
never
actually
spend
it
living
we've
come
to
rely
on
texting
email
facebook
and
secret
pages
like
this
instead
of
having
face
to
face
communication
my
confession
is
that
i'm
just
like
the
rest
of
you
afraid
to
claim
my
words
and
own
up
to
the
truth
because
in
all
honesty
the
truth
is
scary
it
is
painful
to
make
yourself
vulnerable
and
then
get
rejected
but
it
may
be
even
more
painful
to
remain
silent
drunkenconfessions
my
goal
learn
how
to
speak
my
mind
and
i
urge
you
to
do
the
same
if
not
our
words
just
become
meaningless
and
that
my
friends
is
pure
irony
is
it
weird
that
my
boyfriend
wants
to
watch
me
get
fucked
by
other
guys
i'm
a
girl
it's
his
fantasy
and
he
would
probably
not
want
it
to
happen
but
he
masturbates
to
this
are
there
any
guys
out
there
that
do
this
as
well
or
is
my
man
just
bat
shit
crazy
this
is
why
all
badger
fans
are
proud
to
have

how
the

did
i

i
often
see
confessions
on
here
that
complain
about
how
horrible
they
think
other
aggies
are
or
how
tired
they
are
of
a
m
what
were
some
of
y'all
expecting
did
you
think
that
going
to
a
m
would
mean
that
everyone
was
going
to
be
extremely
friendly
and
that
no
one
was
going

be
snobby
or
a
douche
or
whatever
else
going
to
texas
a
m
does
not
determine
the
person
that
you
are
or
that
anyone
else
is
so
don't
be
so
quick
to
generalize
and
then
get
mad
when
people
don't
live
up
to
your
expectations
just
enjoy
your
time
here
be
glad
that
you
are
going
to
a
such
a
good
university
and
stop
judging
every
person
you
meet
based
off
of
what
you
believe
is
the
ideal
aggie
we
are
all
different

that
is
perfectly

i
am
a
prospective
student
after
reading
this
page
i've
become
rather
worried
about
my
safety
i'd
like
some
reassurance
that
the
students
of
lewis
and
clark
really
feel
safe
and
don't
walk
around
campus
in
constant
fear
of
assault
or
loneliness
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
i
understand
that
these
posts
are
probably
the
worst
of
it
all
but
in
a
school
so
small
how
am
i
to
know
that
lewis
and
clark
is
the
right
choice
please
comment
and
let
me
know
overall
what
you
think
of
the
school
academics
social
etc
some
of
these
posts
are
starting
to
make
me
think
twice
about
what
my
top
priority
should
be
thanks
i
really
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
pio
family
1625
i
am
blowjob
girl's
male
counterpart
i
sit
in
class
and
fantasize
about
eating
out
the
girls
in
my
classes
few
things
are
sexier
in
my
book
than
watching
a
beautiful
woman
squirm
while
i
flick
her
clit
with
my
tongue
i
also
like
the
taste
so
ladies
there
are
us
guys
out
there
too
just
saying
admin
note
lol
at
blowjob
girl
it's
like
she's
a
superhero
or
something
related
1626
i'm
a
woman
who
loves
penis
why
is
it
only
cool
when
guys
like
going
down
on
girls
it
ain't
no
confession
but
do
guys
every
like
thicker
ladies
i
mean
still
a
healthy
not
obese
type
but
not
a
skinny
showing
my
belly
type
like
a
little
more
curve
ya
dig
or
nah
i
dropped
out
of
tamu
after
3
years
partially
due
to
emotional
instability
and
my
need
to
be
closer
to
family
now
i'm
going
to
night
school
and
pursuing
a
profitable
career
my
only
regret
from
leaving
tamu
aside
from
crippling
debt
is
that
now
i
don't
know
if
i
can
ever
find
a
girl
who
is
attracted
to
me
and
shares
the
same
interests
as
me
i'm
gonna
be
lucky
to
find
a
girl
who
doesn't
have
kids
already
does
anybody
have
experience
meeting
people
outside
the
college
environment
1688
i
just
accidentally
had
my
first
and
only
all
nighter
of
the
semester
i
had
sex
with
an
old
sexual
partner
who'd
just
broken
up
with
her
bf
for
cheating
on
her
an
hour
earlier
we
had
sex
from
1
30
until
5
30ish
i'm
kinda
worried
i
have
a
problem
because
am
i
really
supposed
to
have
an
erection
that
lasts
for
essentially
all
of
that
time
before
having
an
orgasm
sure
it
wasn't
all
penetrative
sex
and
she
had
plenty
of
orgasms
but
as
much
fun
as
it
was
it
would
be
nice
to
have
an
orgasm
myself
should
i
see
a
doctor
or
something
i
don't
understand
what
3d
printing
is
and
it
scares
me
does
everyone
but
me
know
all
about
it
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
everyone
else
got
all
the
information
when
i
was
out
of
the
room
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
i've
become
extremely
ignorant
no
idea
about
anything
really
politics
no
clue
worldly
affairs
nada
syria
and
snowden
and
whatever
else
is
happening
with
everything
that's
going
on
i
can't
possibly
keep
up
for
any
issue
that's
going
on
today
i'd
have
to
research
the
origins
of
any
problem
which
i
feel
like
could
take
years
how
can
i
start
to
understand
what's
really
going
on
websites
certain
blogs
because
credible
news
articles
bbc
aren't
cuttin
it
someone
tell
me
how
to
get
on
track
i
want
to
understand
why
is
it
okay
for
beyonce
to
make
50
million
promoting
crap
and
not
okay
for
a
ceo
who
"3,000"
employees
and
100
million
in
profit
to
make
5
million
for
himself
this
is
not
even
a
conservative
post
it
is
just
common
sense
why
don't
people
question
shit
instead
of
automatically
wanting
to
crucify
ceo's
now
i
can
understand
ceos
that
sponsor
politicians
like
walmart
who
gave
obama
30
million
but
can't
give
their
employees
more
than
minimum
wage
but
why
do
people
hate
a
small
time
business
owner
who
started
his
business
from
scratch
taxing
them
doesn't
help
shit
it
hurts
people
because
he
has
to
lay
people
off
to
stay
in
business
i
am
not
conservative
i
don't
label
myself
to
such
things
however
i
will
admit
they
have
a
better
understanding
of
basic
economics
than
liberals

since
when
did

turn
into
a

of
essays
like
i'm
trying
to
procrastinate
from
my
schoolwork
yet
these
posts
seem
to
be
more
time
consuming
than
my
textbook
you
know
what
i
hate
when
i
message
a
girl
and
it
says
read
at

pm
and
she
never
responds

i
graduated
last
weekend
and
even
though
i'm
happy
to
be
a
cornell
alum
its
depressing
to
realize
that
the
magical
time
called
college
when
you're
stuffed
in
a
community
with
thousands
of
your
peers
is
over
i
honestly
cannot
imagine
a
more
fullfilling
experience
which
makes
the
goodbyes
so
much
worse
i'll
never
be
able
to
capture
cornell
life
again
but
this
confessions
page
makes
me
feel
like
i'm
still
connected
to
the
rhythm
of
the
hill
so
thank
you
cornell
confessions
for
helping
me
pretend
i'm
still
a
college
kid
on
that
note
i
just
wanna
say
that
you're
gonna
miss
me
when
i'm
gone

why
should
i
have
to
explain
to
my
parents
who
are
worried
sick
about
the
riot
that
just
happened
no
mom
i'm
not
a
bad
kid
i
was
hanging
out
with
a
couple
of
other
ucsb
students
and
drinking
responsibly
as
a
21
year
old
no
mom
i
did
not
join
the
crowd
of
out
of
towners
who
kept
on
yelling
usa
or
fuck
the
police
and
kept
on
throwing
bricks
and
bottles
at
law
enforcement
saturday
night
and
no
mom
i
made
the
right
decision
going
to
this
school
and
i
hope
this
won't
affect
our
rep
why
should
ucsb
students
taking
the
shitty
end
of
this
issue
iv
is
made
of
only
50
ucsb
students
looks
like
there
were
more
out

than

why
will
guys
respond
to
my

in
really
cute
funny
ways
but
never
initiate
14779
i
never
thought
that
cornell
confessions
commenting
was
that
big
a
deal
until
i
noticed
a
somewhat
infamous
commenter
a
few
people
always
announce
_____
for
president
but
most
others
don't
like
him
at
all
has
been
blocking
people
who
disagree
with
him
i
kept
thinking
huh
that's
funny
since
when
did
he
get
so
much
audience
approval
oh
that's
right
he
filtered
out
everyone
who
disagrees
it's
a
shame
maybe
i'm
a
coward
for
posting
this
anonymously
but
i'd
still
like
to
see
what
he
writes
i'm
afraid
if
i
tell
him
this
openly
he'll
block
me
too
17332
i
wrote
a
note
to
this
guy
i
really
like
because
i'm
too
nervous
to
talk
with
him
to
face
to
face
his
large
muscles
and
tanned
polish
skin
literally
render
me
speechless
would
it
be
creepy
to
give
the
note
to
him
and
walk
away
i'm
struggling
because
i
really
want
him
to
know
how
i
feel
okay
senior
girls
stop
complaining
that
no
one
wants
to
be
inside
your
overused
dried
up
vaginas
you
fucked
the
older
guys
instead
of
people
your
own
age
your
whole
cc
career
and
now
that
there's
no
one
older
at
cc
to
screw
you're
kinda
sol
huh
i
saw
a
guy
i
turned
down
last
year
a
few
weeks
ago
he's
gotten
much
better
looking
he
said
he
had
a
girlfriend
i
was
gonna
go
for
it
anyway
he
liked
me
first
right
but
then
he
cuts
me
off
and
says
we
can't
be
friends
i
should
still
go
for
it
right
love
is
cursed
by
monogamy
badgers
let's
all
just
have
a
giant
orgy
dibs
on
the
creator

you
told
me
not
to
drink
so
much
but
do
you
realize
that
youre
the
reason
i
drink
not
sure
if
that
roommate
locking
the
door
post
was
directed
at
me
or
not
but
the
reason
i
started
locking
my
door
all
the
time
is
because
you
kept
on
going
into
my
room
when
i'm
not
there
and
taking
my
stuff
you
want
to
borrow
a
shirt
that's
fine
just
have
the
courtesy
to
ask
me
first
and
it
would
be
awesome
if
you
actually
returned
it
it
weirded
me
out
when
i
came
home
and
everyday
both
my
room
and
bathroom
doors
would
be
wide
open
when
i
left
them
closed
what
in
the
world
did
you
need
to
use
every
single
day
and
why
couldn't
you
just
ask
me
also
you
are
a
slob
you
do
realize
that
you're
not
the
only
person
that
lives
here
right
the
kitchen
looks
like
hell
anytime
that
you
use
it
and
you
let
the
dishes
pile
up
till
they
smell
how
can
you
live
like
that
we
don't
use
the
kitchen
that
much
and
when
we
do
we
rinse
everything
off
and
stick
everything
in
the
dishwasher
the
stove
looks
like
someone
puked
on
it
and
the
microwave
looks
like
someone
took
a
shit
in
it
im
also
sick
of
spending
hours
cleaning
up
after
you
since
its
embarassing
to
bring
people
home
when
you
let
everything
look
like
complete
crap
if
you
want
someone
to
clean
up
after
you
then
hire
a
fucking
maid
please
have
respect
for
other
people's
stuff

whenever
i
tell
people
that
i'm
a
chem
major
they
say
oh
like
breaking
bad
my
reply
is
well
my
mom
didn't
approve
of
my
being
an
assassin
so
yes
i
plan
on
doing
a
real
life
re
enactment
of
bb
minus
the
health
problems
for
me
just
told
my
mom
this
now
she
disapproves
of
my
making
meth
since
it
ruins
people's
lives
her
words
bring
back
acid
instead
it
doesn't
rot
people's
teeth
and
it
takes
them
to
a
higher
level
don't
make
meth
like
he
did
break
your
own
bad
i'm
going
to
do
it
i'm
going
to
break
my
own
bad
where
are
all
the
batman
loving
guys
here
i
really
just
want
to
date
a
guy
that
knows
his
shit
with
batman
but
i
just
feel
like
no
one
here
really
reads
graphic
novels
or
knows
all
of
the
batfam

i'm
a
senior
and
i
have
a
crush
on
a
freshman
is
that
weird
by
the
way
i'm
a
girl
80
of
the
time
these
days
i'm
so
embarrassed
about
my
existence
that
i
just
want
to
throw
up
or
float
away
or
hide
forever
how
do
i
stop
feeling
like
this
i
may
be
needing
the
help
of
the
twelfth
man
on
this
one
ags
so
i
plan
on
proposing
to
my
girlfriend
in
a
few
weeks
she
lives
up
north
and
we've
been
in
a
predominantly
long
distance
relationship
for
three
years
now
i
hope
to
ask
her
on
simpson
drill
field
and
get
hundreds
of
chinese
flying
lanterns
which
is
where
yall
come
in
id
definitely
need
some
help
making
so
many
with
pictures
of
her
and
i
hanging
from
them
i'm
in
the
corps
so
of
course
there
would
be
a
guarded
procession
maybe
get
the
cav
to
fire
off
the
cannon
or
a
21
gun
salute
signifying
the
end
of
single
life
what
do
yall
think
any
suggestions
recommended
changes
is
it
too
tacky
thanks
yall
i
appreciate
your
help
it
kind
of
upsets
me
when
people
treat
the
christian
sororities
on
campus
as
real
sororities
i
understand
that
it's
a
great
way
to
meet
people
they
are
all
extremely
fantastic
human
beings
however
if
you
are
an
atheist
have
repeatedly
stated
so
with
no
plans
of
allowing
jesus
in
your
life
and
even
go
as
far
as
not
allowing
crosses
in
your
apartment
why
are
you
rushing

i'm
a
rising
senior
and
an
international
student
my
parents
can
never
afford
to
come
to
ithaca
for
my
graduation
next
year
i'm
studying
here
on
a
scholarship
and
i'm
grateful
for
it
but
i
honestly
can't
save
up
4000
to
bring
them
over
plus
it's
a
two
days
long
journey
and
would
be
taxing
for
my
aging
parents
they
don't
speak
english
and
have
never
been
on
a
plane
i
saw
my
graduating
friends
pictures
and
everybody
had
their
families
with
them
is
it
common
at
all
to
be
without
your
family
on
graduation
i
feel
so
guilty
for
not
being
able
to
bring
my
parents
here
like
others
do
3529
3490
i
would
like
to
but
this
is
all
anonymous
how
will
i
find
you
5028
i
just
want
to
watch
tv
eat
cupcakes
and
fester
in
bed
all
day
long
is
that
too
much
to
ask
to
the
girl
who
i
ran
into
on
my
longboard
today
11

i
am
very
sorry
next
time
don't
freeze
in
my
way
and
i
promise
i'll
dodge
you
but
you
were
cute
but
before
i
could
ask
for
your
name
you
walked
away
so
how
about
i
make
it
up
to
you
to
the
cute
lifeguard
with
the
baseball
cap
who's
on
duty
while
i'm
in
my
advanced
scuba
class
are
you
just
going
to
stare
at
me
all
semester
or
grow
a
pair
and
ask
me
out
it
gets
tough
sometimes
future
doctors
lawyers
engineers
marry
me
i
had
sex
with
this
girl
all
summer
while
also
telling
her
all
along
that
i'm
not
getting
into
a
relationship
as
well
that
i
won't
be
getting
attached
to
her
she
continues
to
text
me
and
tell
me
her
feelings
along
with
how
much
she
fell
for
me
i
haven't
seen
her
since
school
started
is
it
me
or
is
she
a
little
on
the
crazy
side
how
would
y'all
go
about
getting
her
to
leave
me
alone
because
she
is
just
driving
me
insane
with
her
clinginess
and
bullshit
ok
bitch
why
would
you
give
me
your
number
if
you
are
not
going
to
text
me
back
i
know
we
met
at
north
gate
but
i
like
you
and
i
want
to
take
you
out
i'm
not
looking
to
get
laid
the
real
question
is
why
is
it
that
in
2013
we
can
order
anything
from
our
fucking
cell
phones
but
still
can't
but
dollar
fucking
bills
in
washing
machines
i'm
a
22
year
old
guy
and
i
am
falling
love
with
a
41
year
old
woman
is
that
weird
9028
i
don't
know
what
i
will
do
in
life
i
have
no
clear
career
path
that
i
can
see
myself
attaining
in
the
near
future
everything
i
know
how
to
do
either
depresses
me
or
comes
with
depressed
wages
everything
i
love
seems
out
of
reach
i
had
so
much
potential
so
much
ambition
what
happened
this
place
has
slowly
sapped
my
perseverance
i
begin
to
feel
so
much
better
when
i'm
not
here
i'm
not
myself
on
the
hill
i'm
the
worst
version
of
a
feeble
mind
with
fragile
spirit
help
if
a
man
and
a
woman
are
both
drunk
and
proceed
to
have
sex
then
who
is
the
rapist
in
according
to
the
law
if
the
man
is
more
drunk
the
woman
should
be
charged
stop
the
double
standard
in
our
society
can
we
kick
that
baylor
guy
off
this
page
he's
annoying
and
after
looking
at
his
profile
it's
a
little
bit
sad
that
someone
who
already
graduated
from
a
different
school
is
spending
his
free
time
trolling
a
confessions
page
shouldn't
he
have
a
job
or
something

i'm
tired
of
people
in
the
lgbtq
community
who
think
it's
annoying
when
straight
people
claim
themselves
as
allies
often
saying
that
straight
people
shouldn't
be
proud
as
allies
just
because
they
aren't
homophobic
but
in
the
end
isn't
that
what
lgbtq
wants
a
massive
decrease
if
not
a
total
end
of
homophobia

so
i
stepped
in
a
lot
of
mud
my
socks
got
soaked
and
my
shoes
need
washing
i
realize
i
need
to
do
a
rinse
so
i
don't
clog
up
the
washing
machine
and
go
to
the
nearest
sink
in
the
college
kitchen
i
end
up
washing
my
shoes
in
front
of
three
upperclassmen
and
an
alumnus
whose
conversation
i
interrupted
when
i
walked
in
before
i
think
to
myself
what
the
hell
am
i
doing
people
prepare
food
in
this
but
i
already
started
and
it
would
have
been
too
awkward
to
stop
so
i
kept
rinsing
debating
whether
to
ask
this
junior
guy
on
a
date
i'm
a
bit
of
a
sheepish
freshman
but
so
is
he
honestly
i
wish
i
were
better
at
making
friends
i
need
some
good
girl
friends
ya
know
its
just
hard
when
you
were
bullied
by
girls
all
throughout
elementary
school
and
the
one
that
stuck
with
you
through
it
all
died
in
8th
grade
i
get
a
real
kick
out
of
posting
fake
wpi
crushes
i'm
really
only
making
the
world
happier
what
have
you
accomplished
today
last
year
i
was
15
pounds
lighter
and
complained
about
the
way
i
looked
but
now
i
wish
i
could
go
back
to
that
time
i
look
at
pictures
and
realize
that
i
really
was
skinny
and
cute
i
event
got
so
much
more
guy
attention
i
work
30
hours
a
week
taking
16
hours
and
a
counselor
for
an
organization
so
i
barely
have
time
to
work
out
or
make
food
at
home
any
advice

even
advice
for
small
workouts
that
work
with
someone
who's
on
a
time
crunch
thanks
also
be
happy
with
your
body
because
one
day
you
might
gain
weight
like
me
and
wish
you
looked
the
way
you
did
hey
dude
are
you
busy
actually

being
reproductive

d
to
the
people
in
the
tamug
library
who
were
pretty
much
making
a
baby
in
the
group
study
room

you
not
squeal
all
loud
and
distract
everyone
and
get
a
room
without
windows
next
time
thanks
question
to
the
admins
are
we
allowed
to
post
links
to
pornos
admin
edit

can
send
them
in
and
we'll
just
watch
them
but
we
won't
post
them
ok
ok
so
i
gotta
get
this
off
my
chest
and
i
finally
fucking
figured
it
out
we
are
all
so
damned
blind
it
isn't
even
funny
not
even
funny
man
seriously
this
page
it's
all
a
scam
a
hoax
it's
not
real
my
comment
wont
even
be
posted
because
it
unearths
this
fact
don't
you
see
there
are
no
admins
chronos
ares
zeus
and
never
was
a
loki
we
are
all
being
played
people

think
about
it
all
of
a
sudden
theres
admins
then
admins
0
2
and
then
greek
gods
chronos
runs
the
show
but
zeus
is
the
all
powerful
leader
but
a
pawn
and
a
son
of
zeus
ares
is
a
traiter
and
loki
a
trickster
all
the
admins
are
one
person
one
sliver
of
that
persons
split
personalities
each
admin
lets
the
sole
admin
comment
and
build
the
needs
of
his
split
personalities
it's
one
man
running
it
all
one
man
and
if
you
take
the
three
surviving
admins
of
zeus
ares
and

you
spell
out
the
name
zac
the
sole
admin
the
only
admin
the
only
admin
there
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
is
a
guy
named
zac
i'm
telling
you
guys
this
shit
runs
deep
its
illuminati
remember
their
background
cover
picture
and
profile
picture
this
is
all
one
play
one
ploy
one
lure
to
target
us
all
into
believing
and
accepting
this
distraction
i
promise
you
this
whole
page
is
nothing
but
a
front
set
up
by
the
university
to
get
our
attentions
elsewhere
or
that
zac
is
making
a
power
play
for
something
maybe
director
of
student
affairs
or
dean
or
president
whatever
this
is
real
man
real
heed
my
warnings
before
this
is
too
late
we're
all
being
trained
and
collected
here
our
personalities
and
our
information
forever
locked
away
in
god
knows
what
encrypted
flashdrive
for
whatever
purposes
this
will
never
get
posted
but
if
it
does
don't
get
pulled
in
my
fellow
ags
we
can
do
this
we
can
break
away
just
say
no
to
single
admin
control
and
brainwashing
so
i
was
grinding
with
this
guy
on
northgate
at
basils
and
everythings
awesome
hes
got
his
hands
moving
around
my
ass
and
around
my
thighs
and
on
my
waist
but
every
once
in
a
while
he
put
his
finger
in
my
belly
button
am
i
the
only
one
that
thinks
thats
a
bit
strange
guys
is
that
a
turn
on
2807
all
i
want
is
a
nice
jewish
girl
or
really
any
nice
girl
even
though
my
grandma
wouldn't
be
happy
is
that
too
much
to
ask

these
cornell

make
me
laugh
so
hard
and
is
it
bad
that

find
them

sexual
assault
40
i
was
a
junior
and
we
were
living
in
a
house
off
the
rape
trail
living
here
was
predominantly
a
waste
of
time
as
none
of
the
other
houses
on
the
street
were
interesting
apart
from
a
bunch
of
frat
guys
across
the
road
from
us
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
there
was
zero
potential
on
the
whole
street
or
area
for
that
matter
but
worst
of
all
was
the
fact
that
we
shared
a
wall
with
literally
the
nerdiest
of
nerds
it
would
have
been
a
compliment
to
call
these
guys
and
girl
poindexter
geeks
or
geniuses
because
they
just
sucked
at
everything
these
were
the
worst
type
of
nerds
pc
gamers
what
the
fuck
do
these
kids
bring
to
the
table
i
dont
know
they
had
no
social
skills
no
personal
hygiene
skills
no
skills
in
the
kitchen
they
had
no
skills
at
all
apart
from
perhaps
5
years
experience
dictating
over
a
virtual
empire
of
dwarves
and
pixies
we
were
a
bunch
of
typical
dickheads
out
for
a
good
time
wherever
possible
and
giving
college
our
best
20
effort
so
now
you
know
the
characters
heres
the
story
i
was
nursing
an
incredible
hangover
and
trying
to
complete
an
assignment
to
be
handed
in
the
next
day
while
my
roommates
the
over
committed
alcoholics
were
getting
after
it
as
usual
after
much
abuse
about
being
a
pussybitchsackofshitcocksucker
they
left
me
alone
to
get
on
with
it
while
they
continued
a
standard
wednesday
shitshow
after
about
an
hour
they
were
ready
for
town
and
i
heard
them
stumble
out
the
door
i
had
done
the
obligatory
copy
n
paste
from
google
scholar
and
various
journal
articles
so
my
assignment
was
now
a
completed
masterpiece
and
i
promptly
passed
out
i
woke
up
to
my
roommate
deebz
screaming
at
me
from
my
bedroom
door
which
was
actually
just
a
few
scraps
of
wood
on
hinges
the
remnants
of
an
earlier
incident
kev
kevin
wake
the
fuck
up
kevin
kev
keeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvv
im
gonna
shit
on
the
nerds
doorstep
kevin
he
was
pretty
excited
about
this
particular
venture
and
had
obviously
run
home
from
town
to
tell
me
about
it
and
get
the
work
done
haha
yeah
ok
bro
go
ahead
i
said
still
dazed
and
half
awake
i
got
up
and
followed
him
downstairs
amused
by
the
turn
of
events
then
taken
by
a
sudden
epiphany
i
suggested
bro
take
a
shit
on
this
plate
then
we
can
just
throw
it
inside
their
house
or
leave
it
on
their
bench
of
course
he
could
have
just
shit
right
on
their
deck
or
on
their
bench
but
i
liked
the
idea
of
having
it
on
a
plate
so
we
could
take
it
inside
their
house
and
place
it
strategically
under
one
of
their
beds
or
in
their
fridge
he
was
pumped
about
this
idea
and
took
the
plate
to
the
bathroom
to
do
it
over
the
toilet
so
it
would
catch
any
spillage
a
true
man
is
a
thinking
man
a
few
minutes
after
this
i
hear
an
excited
yell
from
upstairs
kevin
it
looks
like
a
meal
it
looks
like
a
meal
bro
keeevv
i
went
upstairs
to
take
a
look
and
was
met
by
the
overpowering
stench
almost
10
steps
away
working
through
this
i
got
closer
and
lo
and
behold
my
roommate
was
holding
the
delicious
looking
beef
lasagna
he
had
just
cooked
up
it
was
ridiculous
it
looked
like
a
hearty
winter
stew
or
an
indian
curry
or
something
i
couldnt
believe
it
we
were
in
hysterics
at
this
stage
although
the
smell
was
so
bad
that
i
was
trying
not
to
breathe
which
made
laughing
as
hard
as
i
was
a
strange
experience
deebz
didnt
seem
fazed
though
deebz
then
proceeded
to
take
the
meal
off
to
the
nerds
for
deployment
but
walking
through
the
kitchen
we
realized
we
could
make
this
a
whole
lot
better
than
it
already
was
so
taking
some
leftover
kfc
potato
gravy
and
some
broccoli
from
the
fridge
we
lovingly
prepared
these
extra
ingredients
for
the
dish
it
looked
delicious
we
took
a
photo
which
i
will
try
and
unearth
but
i
fear
it
might
be
on
one
of
my
busted
laptops
which
had
too
many
drinks
one
night
so
deebz
took
the
creation
next
door
to
leave
in
their
fridge
or
something
but
alas
the
door
was
locked
the
nerds
had
gone
out
for
once
16546
i
have
a
couple
really
close
friends
here
i
dont
drink
but
i
love
to
dance
and
party
but
the
two
seem
to
be
one
and
the
same
here
i
am
so
conflicted
on
whether
or
not
i
should
join
a
sorority
but
every
feedback
i
get
is
rush
or
it
will
be
terrible
dont
do
it
i
feel
like
it
would
be
a
great
way
to
meet
new
people
but
i
know
that
i
wont
be
into
the
drinking
scene
advice
real
advice
not
just
other
sorority
girls
saying
to
rush
because
they
feel
obligated
or
sorority
haters
who
base
their
judgments
off
of
stereotypes
i
want
to
get
more
involved
with
environmental
awareness
programs
at
school
partly
because
i
care
a
lot
about
the
environment
and
partly
because
i
want
to
learn
more
any
tips
please
post
i
used
torrent
to
download
a
file
on
campus
it
was
a
month
back
and
now
i'm
really
regretting
why
i
did
that
should
i
be
worried
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
i
am
caught
i
hear
things
like
500k
fine
and
stuff

how
is
blondeandthepeeper
not
a
trending
topic
on
twitter
does
anyone
else
ever
wonder
what
happened
to
the
violet
avenger
who
know
who
didn't
win
today
bret
bielema
and
arkansas
people
are
drawing
random
shit
on
a
piece
of
paper
calling
it
abstract
art
and
selling
it
for
millions
while
i'm
over
here
studying
biomedical
engineering
to
actually
contribute
to
society
and
make
an
honest
living
out
of
it
fuck
that
i'm
dropping
out
of
college
and
selling
buttprints
with
lines
through
them
lets
start
the
bidding
at
"100,000"

what
makes
georgetown
students
like
dc
so
much
it's
overrated
nothing
compares
to
nyc
hey
cc
is
looking
to
be
the
school
i
might
attend
next
year
any
advice
or
pros
cons
of
the
school
so
i'm
getting
my
aggie
ring
this
upcoming
semester
the
only
question
i
have
is
natural
gold
or
dark
antique
4730
why
is
it
that
only
gay
guys
tell
me
i'm
pretty
but
straight
ones
never
show
interest
forever
alone
let's
play
a
game
i'm
going
to
kill
myself
can
you
guess
which
dorm
room
is
mine
5303
i
hate
that
it
took
us
till
last
weekend
more
than
a
year
to
start
hanging
out
again
i
had
so
much
fun
seriously
i
hadn't
laughed
that
hard
in
months
and
i
wish
we
were
still
friends
let's
change
that
this
semester
shall
we
305
why
are
most
of
the
desi
muslim
girls
here
haramcores
like
seriously
95
of
them
fall
in
that
category
it's
so
hard
to
find
one
that
doesn't
party
or
smoke
hookah
dresses
modestly
follows
even
some
of
the
basics
of
religious
rules
someone
who's
smart
and
pretty
who
can
provide
an
actual
relationship
that
has
ups
and
downs
filled
with
stuff
like
getting
each
other
a
valentines
day
present
or
going
to
fun
events
together
instead
of
this
we
are
stuck
with
all
these
kamenes
whose
parents
let
them
run
loose
and
now
they
just
seem
like
sex
objects
rather
than
someone
who
is
capable
of
a
real
relationship
i
hope
this
5
is
easy
to
find
in
these
next
few
years

liberal
but
what
if
i
want

be

http

v
boksw_nabek
i
have
just
one
question
what
have
i
done
to
make
my
college
hate
me
so
much
i
keep
trying
to
be
involved
and
i
get
shot
down
at
every
opportunity
i
tried
running
for
office
i
didn't
get
enough
votes
i
applied
to
be
a
paa
i
didn't
get
the
position
even
though
there's
not
a
single
paa
in
my
major
and
i
have
heard
directly
from
oaa
leaders
that
our
head
paas
are
incompetent
i
applied
to
advise
and
i
did
not
get
it
even
though
i
have
coadvised
and
still
have
an
amazing
relationship
with
my
freshman
and
my
host
college
i
apply
for
most
positions
i'm
interested
in
and
every
email
comes
back
no
no
no
but
when
i
go
outside
my
college
i
get
every
single
position
from
coadvisor
to
vp
of
a
club
so
why
brown
college
because
i
can
work
on
whatever
the
problem
is
i
just
wanted
to
help
out
oh
well
i
guess
no
bswb
for
me
question
for
everyone
who
is
majoring
in
typical
liberal
arts
fields
how
do
you
manage
to
ignore
societal
pressure
and
study
what
you
are
passionate
about
i
would
be
so
happy
as
an
english
major
but
my
parents
are
paying
so
much
for
me
to
go
to
college
that
it
feels
like
i
have
no
choice
but
economics
when
you
start
the
night
with
i
have
a
girlfriend
why
are
you
upset
that
all
your
attempts
failed
studies
may
show
that
girls
are
more
attracted
to
guys
already
taken
not
me
i
feel
gross
when
a
guy
with
a
girlfriend
hits
on
me
if
you've
had
sex
in
a
dream
before
are
you
still
a
virgin
i
can
wear
a
big
shirt
and
nike
shorts
if
i
want
to
who
are
you
to
tell
me
what
i
can
wear
to
class
you
must
have
a
lot
of
free
time
to
concern
yourself
with
girls
wearing
oversized
shirts
can't
you
all
complain
about
something
that
actually
affects
your
life
or
is
this
really
your
biggest
problem
annoyed
sorority
girl
who
else
is
feeling
like
this
right
now

i

she
looses

it'll
definitely
take

so
there
was
this
one
time
i
went
to
each
brunch
at
dlg
alone
because
i
was
too
hungry
to
wait
for
my
friends
to
wake
up
i
found
a
2
seater
table
and
sat
by
myself
right
next
to
me
was
a
guy
who
was
also
eating
alone
as
soon
as
he
finished
eating
he
moved
all
his
plates
pulled
up
a
chair
to
my
table
sat
down
and
said
you
probably
don't
like
eating
alone
to
which
i
stupidly
blurted
out
but
i
like
eating
alone
as
soon
as
the
words
came
out
of
my
mouth
i
instantly
regretted
it
he
then
awkwardly
replied
oh
i'm
sorry
grabbed
his
plates
and
left
as
he
was
leaving
i
simply
waved
and
said
thanks
though
bye
but
in
my
mind
i
was
like
nooooo
don't
go
what
a
considerate
guy
i
think
this
is
why
i
don't
have
much
friends
why
am
i
so
awkward
to
considerate
guy
it's
not
you
it's
me
to
op
who
said
a
m
is
full
of
rr's
racist
republicans
some
of
these
ignorant
fucks
don't
even
realize
that
obama
care
is
actually
helping
them
but
they're
so
caught
up
in
being
against
obama
that
they
dont
even
realize
that
they're
against
whats
actually
helping
them
lol
i
think
old
people
and
poor
people
can
die
there
are
no
reasons
to
have
obamacare
when
did
everyone
deserve
to
live
until
their
body
can
live
if
you
can't
afford
it
too
bad
should
have
worked
your
ass
off
there
is
already
a
thing
for
old
people
anyways
if
you
are
so
bitchy
about
how
rich
gets
to
pay
medical
bill
and
live
longer
how
far
are
you
going
to
take
equality
shit
the
world
is
not
fair
and
i
think
it
is
balanced
it
is
not
like
they
charge
million
dollars
for
a
vaccine
you
need
to
live
after
certain
age
other
countries
have
health
insurance
that
the
nation
provides
but
it
only
covers
until
certain
amount
and
i
think
thats
fair
and
thats
equality
dont
bring
racism
or
being
republican
into
this
shit
yeah
i
dont
care
if
the
poor
dies
and
rich
lives
in
time
i
think
thats
how
the
world
should
work
besides
separating
the
poor
people
with
rich
people
and
make
them
harder
to
climb
the
ladder
it's
happening

there's

facebook

doing
this
to

they
are
reasons
why
we
can't
have
nice
things
limitless
suffering
awaits
the
gaming
and
pc
industry
my
friends
i
was
unprepared
for
this
just
living
my
day
as
usual
where
were
you
when
gaming
died
my
friend
and
i
were
riding
the
bus
yesterday
when
it
came
to
a
stop
a
majestic
mythical
beast
that
i
only
believed
to
be
legend
walked
in
it
wore
a
black
fedora
with
a
trench
coat
it
had
a
shirt
that
covered
its
gargantuan
stomach
displaying
a
lone
howling
wolf
it
had
facial
hair
that
only
covered
its
neck
it
saw
my
friend
and
i
staring
and
tipped
its
fedora
towards
us
in
a
ceremonial
fashion.it
sat
towards
the
back
and
pulled
out
a
can
of
mountain
dew
and
what
i
believe
to
be
through
my
studies
a
nintendo
3ds
with
the
sound
on
the
bus
came
to
another
stop
a
woman
walked
in
all
seats
were
taken
except
the
one
next
to
that
beautiful
neck
bearded
creature
she
chose
to
stand
the
beast
then
began
to
exhale
furiously
its
face
reddened
as
it
exclaimed
this
seat
is
open
m'lady
in
a
very
poorly
done
chivalrous
manner
she
looked
very
uncomfortable
but
consented
and
in
response
the
beast
tipped
its
fedora
the
creature
offered
her
some
of
its
cheetos
but
she
respectfully
refused
the
woman
was
wearing
a
shirt
about
god
the
creature
noticed
and
changed
its
tone
into
a
disdainful
pompous
tone
the
shift
was
incredible
ha
it
said
nonchalantly
the
woman
did
nothing
ha
it
repeated
what
is
it
the
woman
asked
as
if
god
exists
it
exclaimed
the
woman
did
not
reply
and
looked
uncomfortable
it
was
happening
my
friend
and
i
had
been
waiting
patiently
for
this
creature
to
act
and
now
it
was
happening
i
read
on
reddit
that
god
was
the
root
of
society's
problem
the
woman
made
the
horrible
mistake
of
asking
it
what
reddit
was
ha
it
replied
reddit
is
a
forum
where
intellectual
libertarians
like
myself
go
and
discuss
pressing
matters
m'lady
my
friend
and
i
watched
in
awe
as
it
spoke
about
the
wonders
of
atheism
libertarians
and
pokemon
the
bus
came
to
a
stop
and
the
creature
excused
itself
due
to
a
pressing
magic
the
gathering
meeting
it
had
i
have
yet
to
figure
out
what
this
meeting
was
but
i
believe
it
to
be
a
cult
the
creature
walked
off
with
its
cane
and
fedora
farewell
it
said
as
it
tipped
its
fedora
one
last
time
and
walked
out
my
friend
and
i
watched
as
this
greasy
beautiful
creature
walked
off
never
to
be
seen
again
and
this
was
my
account
of
witnessing
the
marvel
that
is
a
neckbeard
what
does
marcellus
wallace
look
like
896
is
it
creepy
that
i'm
sweet
on
that
one
young
nice
bus
driver
he's
so
cute
and
friendly
13524
i
really
want
to
make
the
most
of
my
last
semester
at
cornell
and
have
some
fun
with
cute
hot
guys
who
know
how
to
treat
a
girl
right
where
are
you
is
it
bad
that
i
do
not
want
my
family
to
be
involved
in
events
like
ring
day
and
graduation
because
i
feel
as
though
since
they
were
not
there
from
the
beginning
they
should
not
be
there
at
the
end

the
point
of
nyu
secrets
was
always
to
build
community
i
sincerely
believe
that
in
just
over
one
year
and
with
just
under
"20,000"
likes
we
have
come
very
close
to
achieving
that
but
it's
not
enough
i
want
to
do
more
i
want
to
prove
to
the
world
that
not
only
are
we
one
of
the
best
universities
on
the
planet
we
are
also
made
up
of
some
of
the
most
talented
individuals
from
all
across
the
world
and
from
all
walks
of
life
for
this
reason
i
have
been
working
very
hard
on
a
new
initiative
that
will
be
run
under
the
banner
of
nyu
secrets
i
call
it
nyu
secrets
hidden
talents
there
are
some
outlets
that
allow
people
to
show
why
they're
here
but
it's
not
enough
and
the
fractured
nature
of
the
school
does
not
allow
the
individual
talents
of
our
student
body
to
shine
this
is
why
i'm
proud
to
present
www.nyusecrets.tumblr.com
when
the
time
comes
it'll
be
nyusecrets.com
but
the
point
of
this
isn't
the
website
it's
the
fact
that
it
will
be
along
with
this
facebook
page
the
platform
for
nyus
hidden
talents
what
is
nyus
hidden
talents
it's
a
submission
based
way
for
you
or
someone
you
know
to
get
the
recognition
they
deserve
in
front
of
an
audience
of
"20,000"
people
full
details
are
on
the
website
i
will
begin
posting
on
nyus
hidden
talents
within
the
next
couple
of
weeks
and
if
you're
selected
you
will
be
posted
on
both
the
website
and
this
facebook
page
i
have
a
dream
that
this
university
can
when
unified
become
something
far
greater
than
just
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
want
us
to
show
the
world
who
we
are
i
want
us
to
no
longer
be
anonymous
i
want
to
use
nyu
secrets
as
both
the
platform
for
secrets
as
well
as
the
very
real
and
amazing
talents
of
our
student
population
i
hope
this
doesn't
disappoint
i
care
passionately
about
this
project
and
i
hope
that
you'll
all
join
me
in
making
this
as
much
of
a
success
as
we've
made
nyu
secrets
i'm
starting
to
think
the
winter
parking
ban
is
yet
just
another
way
for
unh
to
make
money
off
of
us
poor
college
student
seriously
why
should
we
have
to
pay
75
parking
tickets
or
100
towing
expenses
just
for
parking
at
our
school
on
weekends
when
we
already
shell
out
so
much
for
tuition
2025
i
seriously
just
want
to
piss
blood
so
i
can
say
that
i
pissed
blood
and
resume
living
my
healthy
lifestyle
is
that
too
much
to
ask
hook
a
brotha
up
someone
punch
my
nuts
this
summer
all
i
want
to
do
is
train
hop
across
america
but
everyone
i
ask
to
come
along
looks
at
me
like
i'm
crazy
is
there
anyone
at
tamu
with
as
bad
of
a
case
of
wanderlust
as
me
hey
ladies
do
yall
masturbate
as
much
as
we
guys
do
just
curious
12786
i
think
of
you
often
but
i
rarely
speak
about
you
even
in
front
of
your
close
friends
i'm
afraid
to
mention
your
name
it
seems
that
everyone
has
moved
on
except
for
me
i'm
scared
to
let
you
go
i
want
to
keep
believing
that
you're
alive
and
that
we
simply
don't
talk
to
each
other
anymore
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
strong
urge
to
text
you
but
i'm
afraid
that
your
line
is
disconnected
and
i'll
have
to
face
the
reality
that
you
won't
be
there
to
respond
what
do
i
do
i
feel
stuck
in
the
past
and
everyone
is
whizzing
past
me
but
even
then
i'm
scared
of
what
i'm
not
sure
so
i
keep
running
backwards
against
the
current
and
i
feel
drained
i
miss
you
rip
i'm
a
virgin
and
it
seems
like
my
virgin
friends
are
dropping
like
flies
i
don't
really
care
to
be
honest
everyone
can
make
their
own
choices
obviously
is
it
weird
to
still
be
a
virgin
on
a
campus
where
y'all
virgins
at
i'm
feeling
like
a
shrinking
minority
which
i'm
cool
with
but
just
wanted
to
get
any
measure
if
that's
accurate
to
clarify
i've
had
girlfriends
gone
on
dates
etc
and
i'm
not
looking
for
anyone
to
help
shape
my
life
choices
or
validate
previous
ones
virgin
by
choice
and
ready
to
lose
it
when
i
feel
like
it
but
i
guess
i'm
just
not
rushed
why
don't
y'all
update
a
little
more
often
this
week
you've
been
updating
well
after
noon
and
again
at
like
7pm
i'd
like
to
read
this
shit
during
my
8ams
if
you
think
one
of
the
three
admins
could
manage
to
be
bothered
that
early
eh
guys
i
mean
with
pretentious
names
like
chronos
and
loki
and
whatever
you
would
think
you
guys
would
be
a
little
more
badass
just
sayin
what
attempts
have
there
been
to
bring
down
www.madisonconfessions.com
read
about
it
in
the
latest
blog
posting
i
cover
the
success
of
the
page
i
address
the
reactions
from
the
campus
and
i
give
a
brief
update
on
north
korea

do
people
actually
like
when
their
acquaintances
say
hi
to
them
as
they
walk
around
campus
or
do
they
just
do
it
because
of
social
graces
am
i
the
only
one
who
hates
and
feels
strange
about
these
fleeting
meaningless
interactions
i
want
someone
to
actually
connect
with
me
beyond
a
wave

i'm
supposed
to
work
with
this
girl
every
week
how
am
i
supposed
to
concentrate
when
she's
got
the
two
most
beautiful
eyes
i've
ever
seen
4021
really
guys
how
crippling
is
my
fear
of
rejection
if
anything
it
makes
me
more
active
running
away
from
every
guy
i
actually
have
feelings
for
in
terror
that
they
won't
feel
the
same
way
or
i'll
be
labeled
clingy
or
creepy
daddyissues
why
do
natives
do
not
mingle
with
internationals
students
on
campus
it
hurts
when
people
ignore
you
i
see
so
many
beautiful
girls
in
the
library
that
i
would
love
to
get
know
but
i
don't
know
how
to
talk
to
them
or
get
that
conversation
going
is
that
weird
what
do
i
do
5082
i
heard
some
terrible
things
about
the
wellness
exchange
hotline
i
heard
that
they
laugh
at
your
problems
or
that
they
are
just
downright
not
helpful
so
for
months
i
didnt
call
them
even
though
i
had
so
many
nights
when
i
couldnt
take
it
anymore
but
today
i
hit
a
new
low
in
my
depression
and
i
had
no
one
there
for
me
and
no
other
option
so
i
finally
called
the
hotline
number
a
woman
picked
up
and
i
asked
is
this
where
i
can
talk
to
someone
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
words
yes
im
a
therapist
i
burst
into
tears
she
was
so
sweet
and
she
talked
me
through
my
problems
even
though
i
was
crying
while
explaining
all
of
them
she
helped
me
more
than
i
could
have
even
expected
her
to
im
writing
this
because
i
want
other
people
to
realize
just
how
helpful
the
wellness
exchange
really
is
if
youre
having
a
hard
time
call
them
theyre
there
to
help
you
dont
make
excuses
like
i
did
this
is
such
a
wonderful
service
and
im
so
beyond
grateful
to
have
it
you
should
too
if
youre
dealing
with
something
make
that
phone
call
youre
all
special
and
appreciated
and
you
all
deserve
to
get
the
help
you
need
no
matter
how
small
you
may
think
your
problems
are
dont
be
afraid
to
reach
out
theyre
there
to
help
you
i
cannot
seem
to
fathom
why
so
many
people
like
the
big
bang
theory
a
couple
years
ago
i
remember
my
friends
telling
me
about
how
funny
it
was
so
i
decided
to
watch
it
didn't
even
fucking
smirk
decide
to
watch
it
again
recently
because
i
still
hear
people
talking
about
how
funny
it
is
and
i
figure
maybe
i
was
just
too
young
to
understand
the
jokes
when
i
first
watched
it
nope
not
even
a
chuckle
i
sat
there
pissed
off
at
the
realization
that
i
just
wasted
a
half
hour
of
my
life
watching
this
garbage
people
call
a
television
show
that
annoying
autistic
piece
of
shit
named
sheldon
is
not
funny
in
the
least
every
second
he
was
on
the
screen
i
gradually
became
more
pissed
off
that
blonde
chick
in
the
show
is
ugly
as
hell
i
mean
yeah
she
has
a
nice
body
but
she
has
such
a
stupid
looking
face
i
honestly
can't
see
what
people
find
funny
about
this
show
it's
basically
just
hurr
derr
zabinga
everyone
laughs
what
the
fuck
is
this
shit
how
do
people
find
this
funny

why
does
it
make
you
sad
to
be
around
someone
you
love
heard
some
guys
in
my
lecture
the
other
day
talking
about
their
accomplishments
from
this
past
weekend
one
guy
was
saying
how
the
girl
he
hooked
up
with
told
him
that
she
only
wanted
it
to
be
a
one
night
thing
when
the
gentleman
finished
giving
all
the
details
his
friend
said
she
said
that
what
a
slut
listen
here
young
jedi
of
the
woman
perusing
world
when
you're
grinding
the
basement
of
a
sig
what
are
you
really
looking
for
a
pen
pal
i'm
certain
that's
not
the
case
your
mind
is
on
one
thing
what's
wrong
with
girls
wanting
sex
too
don't
be
a
sexist
prick
or
soon
enough
you
won't
be
able
to
accomplish
anything
so
20
freshman
got
kicked
out
of
stoke
already
way
to
go
kids
for
the
life
of
me
i
wish
i
knew
what
the
hell
the
stupid
score
means
when
you
punch
in
at
the
dining
hall
did
i
win
is
110
good
or
bad
i
just
don't
know
advice
to
all
of
you
awesome
girls
out
there
when
you
have
a
bad
break
up
don't
go
crazy
as
fun
as
that
seems
you
should
instead
drown
your
unhappiness
with
lots
of
wine
or
whiskey
if
you
prefer
and
if
you
do
prefer
whiskey
we
should
be
best
friends
and
time
with
your
best
gal
pals
why
not
go
crazy
you
ask
because
if
you
do
you
might
meet
a
totally
cool
guy
and
months
later
sleep
with
him
it
happens
spoiler
alert
he
has
a
girlfriend
he's
been
hiding
from
everyone
on
planet
college
station
yep
now
you're
an
accidental
home
wrecker
and
no
one
wants
to
be
an
accidental
home
wrecker
so
instead
of
making
those
seemingly
fun
but
actually
terrible
post
break
up
crazy
decisions
go
grab
that
giant
bottle
of
moscato
or
jack
and
have
a
girl's
night
you're
welcome
there
is
an
old
native
american
word
that
transcends
any
literal
dictionary
definition
my
high
shool
philosophy
teacher
once
told
me
about
it
it
is
the
gut
and
most
innate
feeling
of
deep
isolation
and
loneliness
when
one
stares
at
an
expansive
panorama
of
nature
and
realizes
that
we
are
but
one
human
sometimes
i
wonder
why
i
just
feel
like
breaking
down
in
tears
even
though
the
world
is
at
my
fingertips
but
in
a
way
i
know
that
if
one
can
experience
any
sort
of
tremendous
feeling
doesn't
the
exact
opposite
lie
in
store
at
the
end
of
the
spectrum
i
hate
the
word
happy
is
happiness
a
goal
or
the
byproduct
of
something
else
like
feeling
alive
and
in
the
present
i
hate
it
when
they
say
it's
chemical
everything
in
this
world
is
fucking
chemicals
and
just
because
because
my
brain
has
them
doesn't
mean
my
feelings
are
any
less
important
discovered
my
first
real
crush
in
years
i
pursued
this
person
for
a
solid
year
i
finally
started
getting
some
headway
with
this
person
i
care
about
them
so
much
i
can't
even
explain
i
know
they
feel
felt
the
same
but
they
told
me
it
would
never
happen
this
really
makes
me
question
my
self
worth
why
the
fuck
wasn't
i
good
enough
i
was
good
enough
the
other
night
but
not
in
front
of
people
what
is
that
i
know
it's
not
what
you
meant
but
it's
what
you
did
part
of
me
yearns
to
hate
you
so
i
can
move
on
but
i
know
i
never
could
you're
my
best
friend
and
i
love
you
as
such
but
you
broke
my
fucking
heart
2460
is
it
bad
to
masturbate
when
your
roommate
is
sleeping
what
is
it
about
sports
teams
that
make
girls

crazy
in
this
school
guys
are
like
sports
and
girls
are
like
oh
oh
my
is
it
because
they're
in
shape
or
because
they
need
an
excuse
to
sleep
with
someone
i
am
in
shape
a
good
personality
and
never
have
been
on
a
sports
team
in
my
life
but
i
still
need
an
edge
to
get
those
babes
well
guess
what
ladies
i've
lied
about
about
being
on
the
hockey
team
and
it
worked
more
than
once

else
have
money
stolen
from
them
in
the
guys
locker
room
today
at
the
whit

avid
promoter

i'll
never

most
of
these
people
again
hell
yeah
let
the
casual
hook
up
fest
begin
i
was
so
offended
by
every
halloween
costume
i
saw
this
past
weekend
guy
dressed
as
a
bear
offensive
if
i
was
a
bear
i'd
be
pissed
at
his
representation
of
my
natural
being
i
can't
help
being
a
little
furry
cuddly
animal
seriously
though
people
here
need
to
gtf
over
themselves
and
stop
being
so
offended
by
everything
i
wish
the
walls
in
my
dorm
were
thicker
some
of
the
worst
moments
i've
had
at
rice
were
when
i
heard
a
suite
mate
neighbor
or
someone
outside
my
room
talking
shit
about
me
are
they
really
that
stupid
or
want
me
to
hear
them
making
fun
of
me
response
next
time
bust
out
of
your
room
and
join
the
conversation
or
just
smile
confidently
i
bet
the
masks
hiding
their
insecurities
would
instantly
dissolve
384
does
it

almost
every
girl
here

size
of
a
stick

cheeseburger

of
my
childhood

large
nondenominational

major
for
a
specific
reason
besides
that
it's
not
their
own
sometimes
i
don't
know
why
i
was
accepted
at
this
school
everyone
seems
so
smart
around
me
and
i
just
constantly
feel
like
i
have
to
catch
up
when
are
things
going
to
get
better
my
ex
boyfriend
cheated
on
me
with
my
best
friend
they've
now
been
dating
but
little
does
she
know
that
he
wanted
to
cheat
on
her
with
me
i
let
it
happen
once
and
he
still
tries
to
contact
me
not
the
perfect
guy
you
thought
he
was
huh
damn
karma
sucks
my
friend
to
the
bitch
that
threw
me
outta
twomp
last
night
screaming

about
you
freshman

you
gotta
be
like
that
go
hang
out
with
your
friends
and
be
a
bitch
to
them
why
go
out
of
your
way
to
be
a
bitch
is
it
really
that
much
fun
i
wasn't
breaking
shit
i
was
actually
leaving
when
you
threw
me
out
that
encounter
illuminated
to
me
why
bitches
get
smacked
sometimes
you're
just
lucky
i
realized
how
much
of
a
drunk
slutbag
you
were
get
your
shit
together
bitchy
drunk
and
stupid
is
no
way
to
go
through
life
a
vasectomy's
a
medical
procedure
one
that
makes
you
half
a
man
you're
half
a
man
remember
when
you
twisted
up
your
garden
hose
well
essentially
that
is
the
plan
you
make
a
small
incision
in
the
scrotal
skin
isolate
the
vas
and
then
you
hold
in
position
with
a
towel
clamp
then
you
snip
the
fibrous
tissue
hey
but
you'll
never
have
to
wear
a
condom
when
you
do
it
with
your
wife
or
anyone
else
you
do
it
with
we
promise
not
to
tell
like
that
new
hot
chick
at
work
you
know
the
one
who
always
has
high
beams
under
here
ribbed
white
cotton
t
shirt
then
stares
daggers
at
you
for
checking
her
out
and
it's
like
why
do
you
wear
that
if
you
don't
want
the
attention
buy
you
know
you
shouldn't
think
that
way
because
of
the
sexual
harassment
meeting
you
all
had
to
go
to
seriously
how
lame
was
that
and
you
couldn't
help
but
notice
that
the
female
lawyer
running
the
seminar
had
a
huge
rack
like
ridiculously
huge
for
someone
who
has
to
talk
about
that
kind
of
stuff
well
i
guess
that's
the
definition
of
the
word
irony
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
manhood
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
babies
goodbye
say
goodbye
to
kids
like
meg
vacuum
out
your
sack
i'm
quite
bothered
that
there
are
actually
people
both
white
and
black
who
have
a
problem
with
the
cheerios
commercial
featuring
the
biracial
family
i
just
thought
it
was
cute
and
didn't
think
much
about
it
until
later
when
i
considered
that
it
was
probably
the
first
biracial
all
american
family
i'd
seen
on
tv
and
even
that
bothers
me
a
little
there
are
tons
of
mixed
race
families
all
across
america
including
mine
so
why
don't
we
see
more
of
these
types
of
families
in
advertising
have
you
ever
been
alone
at
night
thought
you
heard
footsteps
behind
and
turned
around
and
no
one's
there
and
as
you
quicken
up
your
pace
you
find
it
hard
to
look
again
because
you're
sure
there's
someone
there
3355
i
told
my
best
friend
i
loved
him
he
said
no
and
now
i'm
starting
to
resent
him
we
promised
things
would
go
back
to
normal
but
now
i'm
constantly
mad
at
him
and
i
don't
even
want
to
talk
to
him
anymore
who
knew
by
not
being
in
a
relationship
this
would
ruin
our
friendship
even
more
so
than
being
in
one
im
tired
of
hearing
hearing
people
say
you
should
respect
obama
because
he
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
will
not
respect
him
if
i
think
he
is
doing
a
shitty
job
i
have
a
right
to
have
an
opinion
and
criticize
the
president
even
though
im
sure
obama
wants
to
take
that
right
away
also
the
people
who
say
this
usually
talk
shit
about
their
professors
because
they
dont
know
how
to
teach
do
their
job
how
about
you
respect
him
her
since
he
she
is
in
charge
of
the
classroom
hypocrites

why
are
you
so
difficult
to
read
either
you
are
horrible
at
giving
signs
or
i'm
bad
at
reading
them
or
maybe
you
just
don't
like
me
my
professor
told
me
i
am
beautiful
how
often
does
this
actually
happen
at
a
m
what
do
i
do
do
pokemon

a
bunch
of
money
or
have
i
dedicated
my

dead
end
career

does
the
fox
say
what
do

consider
friends
with

together
and
deep
conversation
etc
902
i've
spent
more
time
going
through
these
confessions
than
on
actual
school
work
this
entire
semester
does
that
mean
i'm
smart
3461
call
me
a
freak
a
slut
or
a
whore
and
pass
judgement
all
you
want
the
thing
is
i've
heard
it
all
before
you
want
to
know
something
i
judge
myself
harder
than
you
will
ever
judge
me
and
i
still
think
i'm
a
pretty
fucking
decent
person
pun
intended
get
off
your
high
horse
guys
what's
the
difference
between
a
cute
girl
and
a
hot
girl
also
which
is
better
i
have
diabetes
it
hurts
to
pee
and
causes
me
to
be
short
with
my
family
i
can't
sleep
at
night
the
other
day
i
stubbed
my
toe
and
took
it
out
on
the
dog
then
two
weeks
ago
we
ran
out
of
vanilla
ice
cream
and
i
struck
my
wife
then
i
find
out
she's
been
dead
for
6
years
who
the
hell
did
i
hit
your
honest
absolute
indifference
to
my
existence
hurts
more
than
anything
i
almost
wish
you
tried
to
avoid
me
or
tried
to
be
mean
at
least
that
would
mean
you
thought
about
me
that
you
take
time
out
of
your
day
to
remember
that
i
exist
maybe
even
that
i
meant
something
to
you
at
any
point
would
you
even
notice
if
i
left
cc
probably
not
i
am
a
girl
and
there
is
a
guy
that
i
am
madly
in
love
with
problem
is
i
think
he
thinks
we're
just
great
friends
ladies
and
men
what
is
a
great
creative
way
to
let
him
know
i
want
to
be
much
more
than
friends

another
woman

her
friends

together

figure
out
how

the
potential

put
the
finishing
touches
on
this
precarious
situation

prominent
position
in

this
year
i
hate
all
of
you
right
now
you're
disgracing
student
government
my
school
and
what
should
be
most
important
to
you
yourselves
do
you
realize
that
anytime
an
employer
google's
your
name
cary
impeachment
will
come

do
fucking

reid

go
shove
your
self
depreciating
i
do
it
for
the
students
bullshit
up
your
ass
if
you
carried
about
the
fucking
student
body
you'd
not
make
sga
into
a
whore
house
for
administration
to
laugh
at
you
want
to
be
taken
seriously
by
anyone
but
yourself
quick
fucking
over
the
voice
of
the
student
body
and
be
professional
i've
had
numerous
administrators
state
behavior
like
this
is
why
they
don't
listen
to
us
sincerely
go
fuck
yourself
senate
leadership
i'm
sitting
in
my
room
by
myself
drinking
tea
at
almost
midnight
on
a
friday
and
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
that
i
don't
particularly
feel
a
need
to
get
shwasty
every
weekend
but
what's
really
bothering
me
right
now
is
curiosity
the
fact
that
i
don't
really
even
know
what
i
may
or
may
not
be
missing
out
on
because
i
honestly
don't
know
the
first
thing
about
going
out
sooo
can
someone
please
fill
me
in
on
how
this
works
i
can't
stand
most
of
the
common
phrases
everyone
at
brown
uses
for
example
beyond
basic
i'm
on
my
insertwordhere
word
i
haven't
seen
you

guys
what
do
you
do
when
you're
on
the
waitlist
for
a
class
do
you
like
talk
to
the
professor
or
anything
when
do
you
leave
if
you
don't
get
in

to
the
cute
short
brunette
ansci
girl
with
the
light
blue
backpack
are
you
a
sheep
cause
your
body
is
unbaaaaalievable
gays
are
born
gay
right
well
if
that's
the
case
aren't
pedophiles
born
pedophiles
so
according
to
you
gay
rights
activists
who
are
we
to
tell
men
in
their
40s
that
they
cannot
have
sexual
relations
with
a
10
year
old
it's
discrimination
we
should
throw
parades
that
exhibit
the
love
between
a
grown
man
woman
and
a
child
and
flaunt
their
relationship
in
everyone's
face
i
mean
it's
natural
right
it's
just
love
as
long
as
the
child
consents
right
i
mean
come
on
our
ancestors
as
adults
would
normally
marry
woman
when
they
were
twelve
so
it's
been
going
on
for
a
while
now
guys
don't
be
intolerant
and
bigoted
towards
pedophilia
just
like
homosexuality
it's
natural
and
right
and
who
are
we
to
intervene
in
such
a
relationship
people
just
can't
help
who
they
love
isn't
that
right
i
cried
when
i
found
out
about
cory
monteith's
finn
hudson
from
glee
death
i
always
watched
glee
and
connected
with
his
character
because
of
his
similar
struggles
i
couldn't
believe
it
when
it
happened
he
honestly
felt
like
a
really
close
friend
to
me
as
a
21
year
old
guy
watching
glee
was
an
outlet
for
me
no
i'm
not
a
closet
homosexual
i'm
just
a
normal
guy
that
loves
practically
every
sport
but
can't
love
musicals
acting
singing
etc
to
all
my
fellow
gleeks
don't
stop

this
is
almost
exactly
how
i
felt
when
my
girlfriend
broke
up
with
me
by
text
message

i've
just
about
gotten
to
my
breaking
point
of
giving
up
on
guys
both
dating
and
friendship
wise
recently
two
of
my
best
guy
friends
have
completely
destroyed
my
trust
both
appeared
to
be
those
genuinely
nice
guys
who
would
never
screw
anyone
over
ever
you
know
who
i'm
talking
about
the
bright
smiles
and
optimist
outlook
on
life
that
everyone
loves
to
be
around
one
of
them
that
i've
known
for
about
two
years
helped
me
through
a
really
rough
time
in
my
life
after
i
was
in
a
serious
accident
this
summer
before
school
started
we
ended
up
hooking
up
and
i
haven't
heard
from
him
since
i
had
never
felt
so
used
before
the
other
i've
been
good
friends
with
since
middle
school
he
came
to
visit
me
this
weekend
and
all
he
tried
to
do
was
hook
up
with
me
because
i
didn't
want
to
lose
my
friendship
with
him
either
i
made
up
an
excuse
as
to
why
i
couldn't
if
the
people
i
consider
to
be
my
best
friends
at
one
point
can't
see
me
more
than
just
an
object
for
sex
how
am
i
supposed
to
have
faith
that
i
can
actually
date
someone
who
will
see
me
for
more
than
that
i
believe
that
strong
solid
friendships
lead
to
great
relationships
but
i'm
too
discouraged
to
trust
anyone
anymore
also
sorry
for
this
post
being
so
long
so
it's
oscar
season
and
after
watching
inside
llewyn
davis
12
years
a
slave
blackfish
her
the
mask
you
live
in
blue
jasmine
and
all
is
lost
i
was
starting
to
get
real
depressed
holy
shit
those
are
some
sad
gems
honestly
i've
been
feeling
pretty
damn
low
then
i
watched
this
and
suddenly
i'm
not
taking
life
so
seriously
anymore

why
are
people
so
sore
about
others
selling
sports
passes
for
high
prices
those
who
got
passes
before
they
ran
out
are
simply
trying
to
make
some
money
here
and
just
taking
advantage
of
the
market
value
for
these
passes
hello
capitalism
wake
smith
why
are
you
so
sexy
i
can't
even
look
at
you
because
i
melt
inside
hey
lady
looking
for
a
pretty
lady
how
do
you
feel
about
fat

i'm
a
prospective
student
and
i
was
wondering
how
the
girls
are
here
are
there
a
lot
of
wifey
material
girls
aka
don't
drink
don't
sloot
around
or
are
they
mostly
shallow
materialistic
sloots
as
depicted
by
this
page
thanks
why
are
all
the
sams
at
this
school
insanely
attractive

my
parents
come
into
the
city
every
week
to
see
me
and
my
sister
and
they
bring
for
each
of
us
a
bag
full
of
usually
perishable
and
homemade
food
that
they
have
no
other
way
to
get
rid
of
whenever
we
tell
them
it's
too
much
they
tell
us
to
offer
it
to
friends
roommates
suitemates
people
in
our
dorm
etc
and
i
hate
telling
her
that
no
one
else
eats
it
no
matter
how
much
i
offer
it
i
hate
that
bag
of
food
more
and
more
every
week
because
it's
food
that
i'm
so
used
to
eating
with
other
people
and
i
know
i'll
have
to
eat
it
alone
and
throw
out
and
waste
whatever
i
can't
finish
because
it
goes
bad
coming
from
a
culture
that
always
shares
food
it
even
starts
to
taste
disgusting
when
i'm
alone
last
night
i
posted
a
picture
of
a
whole
tray
of
food
to
my
dorm's
group
page
telling
everyone
that
i
hate
wasting
food
and
that
anyone
who
wants
food
should
come
get
it
the
first
and
only
comment
was
how
do
i
know
it's
not
poisoned
it
got
a
like
what
the
actual
fuck
offended
and
embarrassed
i
deleted
the
post
and
threw
the
whole
week's
worth
of
food
down
the
garbage
chute
tray
and
all
i
know
this
is
the
city
and
you
should
be
wary
of
strangers
but
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
asshole
says
that
to
another
member
of
his
her
college
dorm
community
those
kinds
of
idiots
don't
understand
the
attempt
to
relate
and
communicate
and
they
shouldn't
say
anything
at
all
i
am
so
fucking
tired
of
this
shit

what
does
a
girl
have
to
do
around
here
to
get
laid
i'm
a
girl
who
likes
gay
porn
and
no
not
lesbian
porn
gay
porn
two
men
getting
it
on
is
the
biggest
turn
on
in
the
world
does
that
make
me
extra
straight
lolz
alex
roose
can
we
please
hook
up
again
after
break
i
looked
at
your
facebook
three
times
today
does
that
make
me
your
facebook
stalker
now
why
do
tamu
galveston
students
get
to
pull
tickets
before
the
main
campus
students
yes
you
still
are
tamu
students
but
we
are
at
the
main
campus
and
i
feel
it
is
unfair
they
pull
before
us
i
don't
like
how
i
had
to
wait
two
years
to
get
second
deck
when
this
year
when
i
finally
do
get
second
deck
i
have
freshmen
sitting
next
to
me
saying
they
got
those
seats
because
they
go
to
tamu
galveston
at
least
pull
at
the
same
time
as
us
what
the
fuck's
a
lommy
sari
lesem
in
addition
to
being
an
overall
awesome
and
beautiful
person
inside
and
out
has
probably
the
most
incredible
ass
i've
ever
seen
the
things
i
would
do
to
her
if
she
ever
let
me
behind
her
where
has
she
been
5381
does
anyone
know
the
name
of
that
ginger
econ
major
who
transferred
last
year
i
heard
she's
non
excludable
and
non
rival
in
consumption
and
i'm
def
tryna
penetrate
that
market
2652
i
would
love
to
know
how
the
posted
secrets
are
picked
do
you
really
read
all
of
them
i
don't
understand
how
the
n
word
is
racist
anymore
i
mean
i
see
african
americans
saying
it
to
each
other
all
the
time
in
a
friendly
manner
heck
some
of
my
friends
who
are
african
american
call
me
it
so
why
is
it
so
bad
when
i
say
it
in
a
friendly
manner
i
can't
sleep
at
nights
so
i
pace
around
the
corridors
i
get
chest
pains
i
run
out
of
breath
i
want
to
cry
but
i
can't
because
everyone
here
is
supposed
to
be
happy
i
don't
qualify
for
a
diagnosis
of
depression
and
anxiety
is
something
everyone
suffers
from
i
understand
why
psychologists
wouldn't
want
to
do
something
about
it
but
i
don't
understand
why
every
time
i
tell
my
friends
they
say
a
fake
oh
i'm
sorry
when
their
facial
expressions
say
anything
but
sorry
more
like
haha
you
deserve
it
i
win
yes
that's
life
but
i
also
thought
that
you
get
what
you
give
where
are
the
genuinely
honest
people
1402
i'm
really
scared
to
come
out
as
genderqueer
especially
because
i
don't
identify
as
trans
i
want
to
take
any
more
of
their
space
when
i
pass
as
cisgender
and
i
have
no
intentions
of
changing
my
body
my
gender
presentation
is
already
androgynous
why
does
gender
have
to
be
such
a
confusing
thing
why
does
it
even
exist
ja
hdfha
pfdh
so
at
first
i
really
liked
unh
but
i'm
starting
to
feel
less
enthusiastic
about
it
i
feel
like
everyone
is
either
obsessed
with
sports
or
partying
don't
get
me
wrong
i
like
those
things
but
i
feel
like
there
isn't
much
balance
reasons
why
unh
is
awesome

i
go
to
notre
dame
and
i
just
saw
this
page
because
my
friend
liked
a
post
on
here
as
someone
who
is
straight
as
an
arrow
and
pro
gay
rights
but
sees
lgbt
students
at
notre
dame
get
hated
by
a
reasonably
small
yet
very
vocal
section
of
campus
every
day
of
the
year
except
for
today
apparently
it's
gay
rights
day
at
nd
i
would
like
to
remind
the
lgbt
community
at
georgetown
that
well
at
least
you
don't
go
to
my
school
i
have
many
a
friend
at
georgetown
and
by
their
description
of
what
the
georgetown
community
is
like
i
have
to
say
props
guys
for
being
the
loving
welcoming
and
socially
responsible
yet
not
religiously
hateful
community
that
nd
was
meant
to
be
11579
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
just
give
all
of
this
up
leave
cornell
dreams
of
a
medical
school
renunciate
everything
and
become
a
buddhist
monk
wandering
in
asia
after
all
what
is
the
point
of
life
i'm
in
the
country's
top
school
actually
one
of
the
world's
top
schools
yet
so
many
of
us
are
miserable
all
this
constant
chasing
around
to
be
in
the
top
25
of
the
class
getting
a
good
job
chasing
for
wealth
thereafter
finding
a
soul
mate
maintaining
one
keeping
up
with
the
jones
working
all
day
till
you
drop
barely
having
time
for
family
no
seriously
what's
the
point
of
it
all
are
you
going
to
be
really
happy
once
you
get
a
wall
st
job
become
a
top
shot
supreme
court
lawyer
join
goldman
sachs
moments
of
disillusionment
before
a
final
5927
there's
a
lesson
some
people
here
need
to
learn
don't
put
others
down
you
are
an
asshole
if
you
do
there
will
always
be
someone
smarter
wealthier
happier
sexier
etc
than
you
on
campus
and
generally
life
i
mean
come
on
do
you
really
want
to
be
labeled
an
asshole
it's
like
when
those
two
guys
gave
me
a
dirty
look
for
not
casually
wearing
j
crew
that
quickly
changed
when
they
found
out
i
casually
wear
paul
stuart
that's
right
you
assholes
how
do
you
get
hair
on
the
ceiling
i
don't
understand
why
gay
marriage
is
such
an
issue
like
really
we
are
going
to
deny
them
the
right
to
marry
just
because
he
she
likes
his
her
own
gender
dude
that's
one
of
he
most
stupid
things
i've
ever
heard
i'm
a
straight
christian
black
man
and
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
girls
loving
girls
and
guys
loving
guys
i
just
think
most
people
need
to
get
off
their
high
horse
and
let
people
live
their
lives
i
mean
damn
my
best
friend
kissing
her
girlfriend
has
no
effect
on
my
life
or
your's
at
all
jr
88
i
seriously
sometimes
just
wish
someone
anyone
would
come
up
to
me
and
say
hey
want
to
bang
yes
yes
i
do
12486
why
do
all
my
friends
come
and
talk
to
me
about
guys
i
have
never
had
a
boyfriend
and
yet
all
of
my
friends
come
to
me
for
advice
on
everything
and
they
say
i
give
good
advice
if
i
give
such
good
advice
why
haven't
i
been
able
to
have
a
successful
relationship
maybe
i
just
haven't
met
the
right
guy
yet
what
would
jesus
do
i'll
tell
you
what
he
wouldn't
do
neglect
the
poor
kill
animals
for
sport
pollute
the
air
we
breathe
show
prejudice
against
other
races
pick
and
choose
what
is
or
isn't
considered
a
sin
while
constantly
judging
and
condemning
others
i'm
pretty
sure
you
can
dumb
down
most
religions
to
something
as
simple
as
don't
be
a
prick
that

not

is
my
single
biggest
regret
at
georgetown
clubs
are
nice
but
i
wish
i
had
a
closer
set
of
guy
friends
i
wish
someone
had
told
me
as
a
freshmen
that
if
you're
on
the
fence
go
for
it
any
fraternities
looking
for

freshman
year
i
went
streaking
here's
the
story
i
wrote
about
it
to
get
a
95
in
engl
401
a
smell
of
alcohol
overwhelms
the
air
the
lights
dimly
glow
scattering
shadows
about
the
walls
a
violet
wash
of
light
cascades
over
a
microphone
stand
and
pa
speaker
at
the
back
of
the
elongated
room
patrons
line
the
sides
of
the
space
bar
at
the
left
tables
at
the
right
the
crashing
sounds
of
the
bowling
alley
next
door
fill
the
ambience
in
combination
with
the
sounds
of
barware
clanging
around
people
speaking
amongst
one
another
but
above
all
rose
the
amplified
callings
of
an
emcee
from
the
rear
kjs
sports
bar
in
newmarket
was
where
mallard
wiseman
and
edmund
the
three
oldest
members
of
the
comedy
troupe
i
had
just
become
a
member
of
were
performing
their
standup
routines
for
the
monthly
competition
that
march
late
winter
night
mallard
as
unpredictable
as
always
completed
his
five
minute
routine
on
the
parallels
of
real
life
and
board
games
of
course
the
candy
land
characters
were
drug
dealers
and
surely
a
get
out
of
jail
free
card
was
used
in
the
o.j
simpson
trials
mallard
lived
in
a
six
person
suite
on
campus
along
with
jameson
a
quieter
but
very
witty
kid
wiseman
who
eats
sleeps
and
breathes
stand
up
comedy
and
then
a
handful
of
friends
edmund
lived
in
the
same
building
but
a
few
doors
down
with
some
other
friends
and
members
of
the
troupe
mary
one
of
two
females
in
mallards
suite
and
me
were
throwing
darts
at
the
side
of
the
room
while
jameson
and
the
others
were
seated
in
the
front
row
of
chairs
at
the
back
of
the
bar
watching
the
current
comedian
who
nobody
knew
nor
did
anyone
particularly
enjoy
i
was
nailing
the
bulls
eye
time
and
time
again
after
that
guy
had
finished
his
non
memorable
five
minute
set
of
jokes
it
was
announced
that
mallard
was
the
winner
of
the
competition
taking
home
fifty
dollars
there
was
a
lucky
feeling
about
us
all
that
night
as
we
left
in
high
spirits
we
had
won
beer
money
mallard
drove
back
to
campus
alone
stopping
at
a
local
grocery
store
along
the
way
to
pick
up
some
booze
he
returned
to
the
suite
to
find
everyone
from
the
group
plus
other
friends
and
suitemates
spending
time
together
in
the
living
room
ready
to
celebrate
the
great
night
with
a
few
drinks
being
a
freshman
with
a
rather
full
course
load
i
only
planned
to
enjoy
one
drink
perhaps
and
then
leave
i
had
a
computer
science
class
early
the
next
morning
i
really
couldnt
afford
to
miss
only
a
few
weeks
into
the
spring
semester
i
was
already
doing
poorly
in
that
programming
class
i
had
always
liked
computers
but
writing
codes
for
them
was
entirely
another
story
altogether
oh
come
on
stay
and
leave
a
good
impression
with
these
guys
youre
gonna
be
on
stage
with
them
for
the
next
three
years
i
thought
to
myself
hey
besides
if
you
leave
too
early
theyll
think
youre
a
stiff
relax
drink
a
brew
then
you
can
go
back
and
sleep
a
few
minutes
had
passed
and
i
finished
a
delicious
blue
moon
with
the
guys
i
stood
up
from
the
couch
to
grab
my
shoes
and
puffy
black
down
jacket
taking
the
breath
with
which
i
would
spend
on
good
nights
and
see
you
tomorrows
until
so
pushing
up
his
glasses
with
a
single
finger
jameson
proposed
i
know
that
im
not
going
to
be
the
only
person
shotgunning
in
the
shower
right
now
tossing
out
cans
of
rolling
rock
from
his
back
pack
to
the
guys
one
at
a
time
he
called
mallard
wiseman
garrett
edmund
oh
why
no
thank
you
i
choose
not
to
enjoy
alcohol
sarcastically
replied
edmund
stroking
the
chin
of
his
beard
which
resembled
that
of
honest
abe
lincolns
i
had
a
lab
in
less
than
eight
hours
and
i
was
already
tired
dude
you
said
one
beer
its
time
to
take
off
then
isnt
it
interestingly
i
was
playing
my
own
devils
advocate
meh
what
the
hell
ill
stay
but
only
for
a
little
bit
before
i
could
second
guess
my
choice
to
hang
around
the
suite
a
bit
if
i'm
logged
onto
my
google
drive
can
the
admin
see
that
i'm
the
one
posting
confessions
i
logged
out
just
in
case
when
asking
a
girl
to
midnight
yell
does
that
mean
we
go
alone
or
can
we
tag
along
with
someone
elses
group
if
that
makes
sense
i'm
still
learning
these
things
i
recently
got

to
the
cornell
ladies
would
you
think
it
was
sweet
if
a
guy
asked
you
out
on
a
real
date
or
would
you
think
it
was
strange
i
enjoy
taking
a
girl
to
a
dinner
date
getting
to
know
them
outside
of
the
drunk
parties
and
shit
trying
to
decide
whether
to
ask
one
out
or
not
she
might
think
i'm
trying
too
hard
i
think
my
roommate
has
self
injury
issues
not
100
sure
but
and
i
don't
know
how
i'm
supposed
to
deal
with
that
would
it
make
my
roommate
feel
guilty
or
something
if
i
ask
about
it
explicitly
any
advice
appreciated

to
the

i
go
to
the
library
with
the
intention
of
picking
up
members
of
the
opposite
sex
last
week
i
met
11
today
2
which
is
hilarious
because
i
was
actually
studying
not
really
a
confession
but
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
other
ags
making
fun
or
hating
on
kids
that
are
blinn
team
or
go
to
blinn
some
people
aren't
as
blessed
to
have
everything
handed
to
them
like
most
of
you
i've
met
some
kids
that
go
to
blinn
that
work
twice
as
hard
as
a
lot
of
us
at
a
m
some
of
them
have
families
they
take
care
of
work
full
time
and
yet
still
go
to
school
full
time
some
of
them
i
have
met
also
had
to
work
to
support
themselves
in
high
school
and
when
you
have
to
support
yourself
making
anything
around
minimum
wage
you
can't
save
up
for
school
or
put
enough
time
in
their
studies
to
make
good
grades
it
really
makes
me
angry
when
i
see
other
ags
criticize
those
kids
one
because
you've
probably
never
been
in
their
shoes
to
have
to
work
and
support
yourself
hell
i'm
sure
a
lot
of
y'all
haven't
even
had
to
work
a
day
in
your
life
better
yet
support
yourself
two
being
an
ag
is
at
the
heart
and
having
certain
morals
most
of
you
who
had
parents
who
were
ags
would
understand
that
if
your
parents
are
alumni
then
naturally
growing
up
you
would
call
yourself
an
aggie
why
because
you
aspired
to
be
one
and
loved
the
idea
of
being
an
ag
having
the
heart
and
morals
of
an
ag
as
well
and
point
three
chewing
them
out
or
giving
them
crap
because
you
don't
think
their
an
aggie
makes
aggies
look
bad
if
some
one
told
you
who
you
could
and
couldn't
be
would
you
want
to
be
like
them
no
it
just
gives
us
bad
rep
and
makes
us
sound
snobby
if
anything
wouldn't
you
want
to
encourage
them
to
come
to
a
m
just
some
food
for
thought
the
next
time
i
physically
hear
some
one
say
that
about
a
blinn
kid
i'm
going
to
punch
them
in
the
face
being
rude
and
telling
people
who
they
are
and
who
they
aren't
isn't
what
a
true
aggie
would
do
how
detrimental
is
it
to
take
a
block
off
what
are
the
cons
5682
any
ladies
still
on

wanna
get

feeling
sad
about

yeah
me
too
ayesha
where
have
you
been
it's
been
so
cold
and
boring
without

i
just
want
a
country
boy
who
listens
to
country
music
and
drives
a
truck
why
is
that
so
hard
to
find

i
think
it's
ridiculous
how
much
hillel
is
used
as
a
feeder
organization
to
get
students
to
join
greek
life
sometimes
i
feel
like
there's
no
place
for
me
there
because
if
you
aren't
in
greek
like
you
are
super
religious
but
i
am
neither
it's
ridiculous
there's
even
a
jewish
greek
council
like
what
do
they
even
do
930
i
know
it's
not
just
me
but
does
anyone
else
occasionally
see
that
yellow
lamborghini
and
silver
ferrari
circling
around
in
iv
not
sure
if
it's
some
spoiled
kid's
joy
ride
or
some
rich
asshole
probably
one
of
our
undeserving
landlords
but
the
driver
sure
loves
showing
it
off
and
making
loud
noises
and
one
more
thing
fuck
our
landlords
they
know
we're
here
temporarily
therefore
they
know
you
won't
take
action
against
them
i
love
a
m
have
lots
of
friends
there
and
really
enjoy
the
atmosphere
however
i
am
transferring
to
ut
to
finish
out
my
degree
that
makes
me
a
traitor
doesn't
it
don't
hate
gotta
follow
the
money
trail
lol
xd
who's
ready
to
turn
up
this
weekend
why
do
i
feel
more
threatened
by
the
girl
you
made
out
with
once
than
i
do
all
the
guys
you've
hooked
up
with
before
we
started
dating
stop
sweet
baby
jesus
get
a
hold
of
yourself
i
broke
up
with
you
a
week
ago
and
you
post
like
20
tweets
and
statuses
a
day
about
how
you're
fixing
yourself
to
get
me
back
i
don't
want
you
back
you
know
that
song
i
wrote
you
the
song
that
you
keep
saying
you're
listening
to
on
repeat
yeah
when
i
first
played
it
for
you
you
said
the
song
your
ex
wrote
for
you
was
better
you
fucker
so
don't
say
you
magically
like
it
now
maybe
you
should
have
thought
about
the
fact
that
i
could
leave
you
before
you
called
me
a
bitch
a
cunt
and
screamed
at
me
pretty
much
every
day
for
the
last
2
3
months
of
our
relationship
the
only
stupid
part
here
besides
you
is
that
i
didn't
leave
you
sooner
and
you
know
what
i'm
fucking
someone
else
and
he's
better
than
you
so
stop
being
a
pathetic
little
girl
and
get
your
shit
together
cause
i'm
not
coming
back
and
you
better
fucking
get
used
to
life
without
me
i
want
to
do
a
performance
art
on
the
worner
quad
but

allowed
i
want
to
sit
on
the
worner
quad
naked
with
my
legs
open
that
is
with
my
vagina
vulva
wide
open
beside
a
sign
that
says
we
may
not
know
each
other
but
see
my
soul
by
kissing
my
vulva
with
your
eyes
closed
is
it
legal
to
do
that
thoughts
on
snowden
discuss
question
for
the
religious
women
here
can
you
see
yourself
dating
anyone
outside
your
religion
for
example
if
you
are
a
christian
could
you
see
yourself
dating
a
jew
muslim
or
even
an
atheist
if
no
why
what
is
the
nicest
way
to
tell
your
boyfriend
he
is
crowding
the
fuck
out
of
you
i
don't
want
to
break
up
with
him
and
i
don't
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
if
i
watch
breaking
bad
with
my
psych
notes
in
front
of
me
does
that
count
as
studying
may
be
i
am
naive
when
people
here
talk
about
being
thirsty
do
they
actually
mean
horny
i
need
ideas
for
a
senior
bucket
list
any
ideas
i
am
a
fuego
addict
i
have
to
have
it
at
least
5
times
per
week
is
there
anyone
out
there
that
shares
my
problem

we
have
an
aa
thing
that's
more
styled
towards
fuego
i
need
help
4778
i
used
to
and
still
do
i
guess
think
this
guy
is
really
really
cute
i
was
in
the
same
class
as
him
for
a
few
times
but
has
never
talked
to
him
and
whenever
in
class
or
on
campus
when
walking
by
i
can't
stop
but
to
develop
a
crush
for
him
until
this
other
day
i
saw
him
walking
with
a
guy
who
looked
identical
to
him
and
learned
that
he
is
a
twin
huhuhuhuhhh
so
which
one
of
them
did
i
really
fall
for
i
could
havebeen
in
class
with
both
of
them
or
walked
by
both
of
them
i
feel
a
little
pathetic
i
need
a
redneck
man
to
act
like
a
tractor
and
plow
my
bottom
forty
any
takers
back
in
highschool
i
made
the
closest
friend
i
ever
had
she
didn't
go
to
my
school
just
met
her
through
a
mutual
friend
she
quickly
became
a
sister
to
me
we
were
inseparable
every
minute
i
was
not
in
class
or
working
i
was
at
her
house
having
a
great
time
our
friendship
got
strained
and
we
started
bickering
a
little
then
her
boyfriend
started
texting
me
at
first
just
casually
then
flirty
id
never
had
a
boyfriend
before
and
never
gotten
any
attention
from
a
guy
mostly
because
all
my
friends
were
skinny
and
beautiful
so
our
friendship
declined
pretty
fast
she
moved
to
a
different
state
and
her
and
her
boyfriend
broke
up
over
a
stupid
fight
with
the
intentions
of
getting
back
with
him
but
he
immediately
asked
me
out
and
started
ignoring
her
so
behind
her
back
i
dated
him
when
she
found
out
it
completely
ruined
our
friendship
and
i
feel
so
horrible
about
the
whole
situation
needless
to
say
he
was
my
boyfriend
of
2
years
cheated
on
me
2
times
and
i'm
finally
done
with
him
she
just
recently
started
talking
to
me
again
and
i
feel
so
ashamed
but
she
reassured
me
that
the
past
is
the
past
don't
steal
your
best
friends
boyfriend
you'll
regret
it
for
ever
and
it
won't
work
out
am
i
a
horrible
person
i
tell
myself
every
day
that
people
just
make
mistakes
but
it's
still
hard
to
feel
ok
about
it
all
i
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
pretty
big
manwhore
because
i
get
drunk
and
make
out
a
lot
because
who
doesn't
like
making
out
all
my
frat
bros
think
i'm
constantly
getting
laid
and
respect
me
for
it
secretly
though
it's
been
about
two
years
since
my
last
time
because
i
just
don't
like
meaningless
sex
i
wish
people
weren't
so
shy
about
pooping
in
bathrooms
when
other
people
are
also
in
the
bathroom
why
because
i
could
poop
fine
in
public
dorm
bathrooms
until
i
found
out
other
people
were
self
conscious
about
it
and
now
i
am
too
damn
it
i
just
want
to
be
able
to
poop
when
i
have
to
poop
i
think
the
lead
guitar
playing
in
funkdozer
is
so
sexy
who
are
you
at
this
rate
we'll
finally
be
able
to
know
if
ghost
exists
how
you
may
ask
well
considering
how
some
of
this
generation
likes
to
take
a
selfie
we
would
only
need
to
leave
a
phone
in
a
dark
restroom
and
wait
for
the
ghost
to
take
a
selfie
i
know
this
isn't
a
confession
just
something
random
that
crossed
my
mind
in
one
of
my
classes
there
is
this
very
attractive
girl
that
i
am
certain
we
are
both
interested
in
each
other
i
have
talked
to
her
on
a
few
occasions
and
gotten
to
know
a
little
about
her
however
i
think
she
is
very
religious
and
i
haven't
stepped
foot
in
a
church
in
i
couldn't
tell
you
how
long
i'm
not
a
bad
person
or
a
bad
boy
i
just
don't
go
to
church
should
i
stop
while
i'm
still
ahead
11773
i
mean
i
kind
of
awfully
agree
with
you
because
i
used
to
be
obese
but
lost
a
ton
of
weight
this
year
and
i
do
think
a
huge
part
of
it
is
self
control
and
on
some
level
i
do
judge
people
with
the
whole
if
i
did
it
why
can't
you
but
at
the
same
time
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
know
what
is
going
on
their
lives
so
who
are
we
to
judge
fat
people
like
that
11752
it's
because
being
fat
is
only
excusable
if
you
have
a
medical
condition
if
you
don't
have
enough
self
control
to
keep
your
own
body
in
check
i'm
going
to
have
a
terrible
opinion
of
you
we
graduated
but
i
still
remember
sophomore
year
you
were
on
the
second
floor
in
the
library
i
waved
and
you
waved
back
i
could
smell
your
cologne
from
outside
the
room
i
coincidentally
had
picked
the
room
right
next
to
yours
without
knowing
you
left
and
being
my
creepy
wonderful
self
i
walked
into
the
room
you
were
in
a
just
a
minute
ago
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
letting
your
incredible
cologne
take
over
my
senses
it
was
the
best
smelling
thing
i
had
ever
come
across
yes
creepy
but
strangely
romantic
3
years
later
and
i
can
recall
the
smell
i
liked
you
then
and
i
still
like
you
know
i
don't
know
why
18275
i
actually
don't
even
have
the
will
to
live
anymore
it's
only
been
my
first
semester
but
i
absolutely
hate
cornell
more
than
anyone
i
know
this
place
just
disgusts
me
everyone
around
me
is
so
fake
my
friends
are
assholes
my
classes
are
too
hard
i
don't
want
to
study
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
i
f
cking
made
the
worst
mistake
of
my
life
coming
here
my
grades
are
sh
t
and
they
literally
make
me
cry
every
night
i'm
painfully
aware
that
i
have
to
work
thrice
as
hard
as
those
around
me
to
make
it
to
where
they
are
but
now
that
i'm
in
college
i
don't
want
that
i
want
to
have
fun
i
want
to
be
around
people
who
don't
insult
me
all
of
the
time
i'm
so
f
cking
tired
of
this
i
feel
like
i'm
having
a
mental
breakdown
i'm
so
stuck
holy
f
ck
this
is
not
going
to
get
any
better
if
i
say
i
hate
cornell
folks
respond
with
just
transfer
really
to
f
cking
where
no
one's
going
to
take
a
broke
angry
teenager
on
a
sh
t
ton
of
fin
aid
with
a
crappy
gpa
not
even
sure
transferring
to
another
top
school
would
help
these
schools
don't
give
a
f
ck
about
the
kids
who
struggle
who
are
dirt
poor
i
swear
i
regret
even
trying
in
high
school
all
of
that
work
for
what
this
i'm
done
2841
is
it
so
wrong
to
just
want
to
have
dated
at
least
one
person
by
now
i
mean
i
don't
really
need
to
be
with
anyone
but
its
just
kind
of
demoralizing
that
no
one
ever
shows
any
interest
like
fuck.am
i
ugly
am
i
too
fat
am
i
ethnically
displeasing
girls
that
think
guys
don't
get
image
problems
are
solo
wrong
i'm
not
saying
ladies
don't
have
it
hard
but
don't
think
guys
are
immune
since
i
was
like
13
i've
worried
i'll
get
fatter
and
that
i
am
already
fat
like
wtf
i
weight
170
and
am
like
6'4
i'm
damn
near
underwear
for
my
height
furthermore
i
am
not
white
and
its
hard
enough
being
a
minority
in
a
diverse
city
but
moving
to
oregon
kind
of
just
makes
me
never
want
to
go
downtown
alone
b
c
then
i'll
no
one
to
distract
me
from
the
feeling
of
everyone
looking
at
me
like
hey
a
black
person
sometimes
i
just
sit
there
and
think
if
i
were
white
someone
would
want
to
date
me
because
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
say
i
wouldn't
want
to
date
me
it
really
kind
of
hurts
i
have
to
admit
i
do
masturbate
which
i'm
pretty
sure
most
of
you
who
comment
on
this
page
do
as
well
honestly
i
want
to
stop
for
religious
and
mostly
personal
reasons
it's
difficult
for
me
to
stop
because
it's
a
great
way
to
release
stress
especially
around
test
dates
or
when
i
get
a
horrible
grade
on
an
assignment
or
quiz
and
have
to
worry
about
how
well
i
need
to
do
next
time
is
there
any
advice
you
can
give
to
help
me
distract
myself
from
jacking
off
and
finding
a
way
to
deal
with
my
stress
also
no
i
do
not
have
a
gf
and
yes
i'm
a
guy
also
i
live
in
a
dorm
so
no
cats
or
dogs
are
an
option
780
when
it's
hot
in
the
library
so
i
take
my
jacket
off
and
knock
my
book
off
in
the
process
so
everyone
is
staring
at
me
after
a
few
moments
i'm
irritated
cuz
like
why
are
they
still
staring
at
me
then
i
realize
i
forgot
i
am
not
wearing
a
bra
under
my
shirt
and
my
nipples
are
hard
i
am
sitting
here
with
a
red
face
debating
on
just
killing
myself
or
submitting

that
color
you
guys
keep
talking
about
it's
called

red
not

get
it
right
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
a
girl
to
like
a
jazz
nerd
like
me
someone
who
doesn't
mind
the
blue
note
references
someone
who
can
call
me
their
miles

someone
who
would
be
willing
to
say
that's
my
man
playing
free
jazz
in
the
corner
is
there
any
kind
of
girl
like
that
out
there
i
enjoy
soloing
cuddling
up
while
watching
classic
swing
era
movies
and
even
taking
time
from
my
record
listening
to
make
her
happy
i
want
someone
i
can
take
home
to
see
my
sax
collection
not
the
bed
room
i
still
play
basic
blues
progressions
defend
her
when
she
needs
to
improve
on
her
playing
and
care
for
her
instrument
when
shes
sick
i
guess
i'm
just
a
lonely
jazz
nerd
who
can't
find
his
ella
fitzgerald
his
sarah
vaughan
or
his
billie
holiday
she's
a
famous
jazz
singer
if
you
didn't
catch
that
last
one
p.s
i
know
i
will
get
the
usual
trolls
that
say
i'm
thirsty
please
if
you
want
to
comment
that
make
sure
its
funny
at
least
put
as
much
effort
into
as
you
did
to
read
this
professors
read
this
page
i
know
this
because
i
am
one
my
friends
and
i
read
this
page
to
see
if
anyone
will
bitch
about
us
or
say
something
flattering
so
who
is
your
favorite
prof
i
just
want
a
nice
girl
who
loves
star
wars
is
that
too
much
for
a
nerd
to
ask
for

this
cute
little
indian
chick
that's
commented
on
a
few
posts
on

or

can
i
find
her
in
this
sea
of
cornellians

this
sexy
kinda
tall
kid
named
amer
in
my
bio
class
that
i
reallyyy
like
i
smile
at
him
everyday
but
he
never
notices
me
what
should
i
doooo
1913
seeing
all
these
posts
about
guys
coming
up
with
the
nerve
to
confront
girls
or
raving
about
some
girl
they've
seen
and
want
to
get
to
know
had
me
wondering
why
was
i
never
treated
like
that
quiet
girls
are
always
ignored
hey
guys
what's
the
best
way
for
a
girl
to
ask
a
guy
out
this
is
more
of
a
question
for
ladies
how
do
you
feel
about
small
dicks
i
met
my
child's
father
in
my
first
year
in
college
and
was
that
girl
that
got
knocked
up
within
the
first
six
months
no
rude
comments
please
i
know
i
was
irresponsible
i
broke
up
with
him
because
he
wanted
me
to
drop
out
and
was
emotionally
abusive
and
now
he's
getting
married.he
lives
back
home
in
south
texas
and
has
made
several
attempts
to
get
me
back
and
i
blow
him
off
and
focus
on
finishing
my
degree
and
being
a
good
mother
problem
is
now
he's
getting
married
and
i
feel
like
maybe
i
screwed
up
and
my
son
will
never
know
what
it's
like
to
have
both
parents
together
and
happy
am
i
wrong
for
this
7855
i'm
a
girl
and
the
majority
of
my
friends
here
are
male
i
feel
more
comfortable
and
less
judged
around
them
am
i
be
only
one
who
feels
this
way
11320
extremely
nervous
about
posting
this
but
are
there
any
orthodox
christians
at

6988
to
the
sorority
girls
arguing
about
who
is
going
to
live
with
who
in
which
room
in
the
house
in
the
third
row
of
2080
lecture
stfu
why'd
you
come
to
class
to
annoy
everyone
else
with
your
drama
instead
of
dealing
with
it
productively
at
another
time
guys
so
i'm
in
a
bit
of
a
predicament
and
could
use
some
advice
there's
this
girl
who
i've
been
talking
to
lately
and
it's
completely
obvious
that
she
likes
me
i
met
her
in
my
philosophy
class
and
she's
sweet
and
smart
and
i
find
her
very
pretty
the
only
con
is
that
she's
religious
which
means
she
wants
me
to
go
to
church
and
bible
studies
and
shit
i've
already
agreed
to
go
with
her
to
one
which
i
know
i'll
dread
but
then
there's
this
other
girl
who
i
find
beautiful
she's
funny
and
always
makes
me
laugh
and
the
best
part
is
that
she
isn't
religious
so
what
should
i
do
should
i
settle
for
the
first
girl
90
she'll
day
yes
to
go
on
a
date
with
me
or
go
for
the
girl
i'm
very
attracted
to
50
she'll
say
yes
to
a
date
it's
been
a
while
since
i've
been
in
a
true
relationship
mostly
flings
and
i
don't
want
to
fuck
myself
over
so
i
just
need
some
honesty
advice
are
any
of
you
familiar
with
the
term
rally
yes
i
know
you
drank
last
night
and
yes
i
understand
you
drank
all
day
but
take
a
fucking
nap
and
get
back
out
there
or
don't
that's
fine
too
but
stop
pretending
we
party
hard
here
when
there's
5
people
out
on
a
saturday
night
hey
guys
hope
everyone
is
having
a
good
week

far
we
want
to
introduce
to
you
the
new

gays

opinion
on
gay
being
genetic
i
will
never
bring
this
up
at
church
again
because
they
will
just
sit
there
and
be
totally
against
people
being
gay
most
of
my
church
friends
also
say
that
they
can
choose
not
to
follow
their
temptations
but
could
my
church
friends
choose
not
follow
their
temptations
with
the
opposite
sex
i
don't
think
so
i
know
i
couldn't
stay
away
from
the
opposite
sex
all
my
life
15321
i
graduated
and
you're
still
there
we
had
an
incredible
connection
and
sex
but
you're
not
ready
to
be
with
anyone
how
long
can
i
wait
before
giving
up
on
you
i
know
you
are
bad
for
my
health
but
i
can't
get
myself
to
realize
that
most
of
the
time
oh
soccer
why
am
i
so
obsessed
with
you
it's
so
hard
not
to
develop
a
crush
on
one
of
the
cadets
especially
in
the
figthin
texas
aggie
band
especially
if
they
play
that
sexy
saxophone
and
are
so
sweet
too
wonder
if
most
of
them
are
taken
16510
i
love
you
but
being
with
you
makes
me
feel
bad
about
myself
is
my
love
for
you
worth
it
fuck
you
how
could
you
do
this
to
me
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
so
much
i
am
worth
so
much
more
than
this
and
i
am
tired
of
you
treating
me
like
shit
i
am
not
like
other
girls
i
don't
play
these
games
i
cared
about
you
and
i
thought
you
cared
about
me
clearly
it
was
all
a
lie
all
those
months
we
spent
together
you
are
a
scumbag
i
hate
you
for
kissing
me
like
you
meant
it
i
hate
you
for
making
me
feel
worthless
i
am
not
worthless
i
am
a
fucking
good
person
but
because
of
you
it
is
going
to
take
me
so
long
to
convince
myself
of
that
so
thanks
oh
and
go
fuck
yourself
a
friend
a
kenyon
student
confided
in
me
that
she
was
raped
by
another
student
who
i
know
this
student
has
apparently
also
raped
at
least
one
other
person
as
well
the
more
time
passes
the
more
i
feel
compelled
to
do
something
but
i
don't
want
to
violate
my
friend's
confidence

girls
did
you
ever
stop
and
think
that
maybe
you're
the
ones
that
should
put
the
seat
up
we
don't
like
touching
it
either
and
all
you
ever
do
is
whine
about
equality
how
about
some
equality
in
bathroom
etiquette
to
the
op
who
sat
next
to
a
turban
guy
let
me
tell
you
three
things
1
sikhs
tie
turban
in
the
us
muslims
don't
these
are
two
separate
religions
you
are
really
dumb
for
generalizing
based
off
media
2
even
if
i
was
a
muslim
then
what
you
are
a
judgmental
and
shallow
minded
person
for
thinking
every
muslim
is
the
same
3
you
are
nothing
more
than
an
anonymous
loser
who
spreads
hate
behind
an
anonymous
post
if
you
had
the
balls
you
would
talk
in
person
and
find
out
if
i
listen
to
your
crap
maybe
you
are
embarrassed
that
your
ignorance
is
so
strong
that
even
your
fully
aware
friends
will
laugh
at
you
next
time
you
see
a
guy
with
a
turban
ask
them
what
turban
means
and
they
will
tell
you
that
turban
is
their
commitment
towards
standing
up
for
others
too
bad
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
ask
a
sikh
for
help
because
you
are
a
judgmental
bigot
if
you
ever
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
and
at
the
level
of
your
ignorance
feel
free
to
get
a
turban
tied
on
the
tie
a
turban
day
or
reach
out
to
sikh
student
association
ps
no
matter
how
much
of
an
asshole
you
turn
out
to
be
sikhs
will
always
pray
for
your
well
being
because
we
pray
for
blessings
for
everyone

i
confess
i
was
really
disappointed
by
the
season
finale
of
how
i
met
your
mother
tonight
kind
of
sucks
as
i
took
my
only
study
break
today
to
watch
it
was
anyone
else
disappointed
this
was
probably
the
best
christmas
ive
ever
had
this
is
because
i
truly
understand
what
it
means
now
i
woke
up
and
had
a
delicious
breakfast
with
my
family
i
didn't
open
any
presents
after
nor
did
my
brothers
truth
is
my
mom
hasn't
been
able
to
afford
christmas
gifts
for
the
past
2
years
after
flipping
through
my
instagram
i
felt
a
little
jealous
seeing
my
friends
with
new
shoes
iphones
and
what
not
we
later
drove
out
to
my
aunts
and
uncles
house
who
are
unh
alumni
for
a
great
day
of
family
bonding
we
played
poker
made
a
bonfire
shot
some
guns
drank
a
shit
ton
and
shared
many
laughs
during
our
amazing
dinner
my
little
cousin
asked
what
did
you
guys
get
for
christmas
after
seeing
them
open
an
xbox
360
and
other
awesome
kid
things
earlier
there
was
an
obvious
awkward
moment
of
silence
i
then
replied
to
her
we
opened
our
hearts
and
received
family
health
and
love
this
year
i
am
truly
blessed
and
appreciate
everything
i
have
in
this
world
merry
christmas
wildcats

for
all
those
who
are
bummed
about
prelims
don't
worry
so
many
people
are
in
the
same
boat
as
you
it
might
seem
like
a
big
deal
right
now
but
there's
more
prelims
to
do
better
in
here's
invigorating
song
for
the
day

v
lkgqncvifok
i
do
more
community
service
than
i
need
to
do

seat
up
to
those
who
need
it
more
treat
others
with
the
utmost
respect
and
kindness
etc
i
am
a
good
person
and
have
self
confidence
why
doesn't
anyone
want
to
hit
this
is
it
because
i
am
literally
running
every
where
if
so
hurry
the
hell
up
i
wish
girls
here
and
in
general
would
be
more
blatant
about
their
affections
for
guys
how
the
fuck
am
i
supposed
to
know
if
you
like
me
or
not
smiling
at
a
guy
as
you
pass
him
or
laughing
at
his
stupid
ass
jokes
is
not
nearly
strong
enough
of
a
hint
to
get
him
to
realize
that
you're
into
him
tell
guys
outright
that
you
fancy
them
i
guarantee
you
that
they
will
not
be
weirded
out
they
will
be
flattered
you
will
have
made
their
day
and
if
they
aren't
they
can
go
fuck
themselves

i'm
about
to
graduate
don't
have
a
job
yet
and
i'm
married
already
yeahhh
i'm
only
21
and
are
married
already
but
i
do
think
he
is
my
true
soulmate
i
love
him
so
much
and
wouldn't
change
him
for
anyone
yet
he
has
a
full
time
job
and
works
more
than
12
hours
per
day
so
the
only
time
we
have
sex
is
on
weekends
i
don't
complain
because
he
works
so
much
to
give
me
everything
but
i
need
more
than
just
once
a
week
advice
i
hate
the
fact
that
most
girls
at
a
m
are
shy
where
are
the
outgoing
girls
at
no
i'm
not
an
engineer
16300
can
someone
please
explain
to
me
why
people
go
to
great
lengths
to
act
as
though
they
want
to
date
when
in
fact
they
only
want
a
hookup
please
please
please
don't
keep
wasting
my
time
i'm
ready
to
settle
down
and
date
not
f
ck
once
17434
sometimes
i
feel
like
a
hater
but
it's
hard
not
to
compare
myself
to
people
i'm
sick
of
fb
statuses
about
people's
straight
a's
at
community
colleges
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
anyone
who
cannot
afford
or
immediately
attend
a
4
year
institution
and
yet
still
finds
a
way
to
pursue
higher
education
however
i
wish
they
could
be
a
little
less
egotistical
about
their
grades
i
don't
need
to
read
about
or
see
the
picture
of
your
100
score
on
an
algebra
test
like
it's
high
school
good
for
you
that
you
finally
learned
or
are
relearning
something
we
should
have
mastered
in
the
junior
high
we
both
attended
tell
your
friends
and
family
privately
they'll
still
congratulate
you
i
miss
the
super
high
grades
that
no
longer
come
easily
and
of
course
i
need
to
quit
b
tching
on
fb
and
go
study
i
will
it's
just
that
sometimes
i
think
coming
here
was
a
mistake
if
i'd
gone
to
an
easier
school
i
would
probably
have
a
higher
gpa
yes
increased
competition
could
augment
work
ethic
but
i
think
the
converse
is
true
in
my
case
and
self
esteem
what
if
cornell
never
becomes
worth
it
for
me
and
i've
wasted
all
this
time
and
money
to
become
a
housewife
and
stay
at
home
mom
which
are
perfectly
fine
occupations
if
that's
what
you're
into
but
i
would
hate
myself
what
do
sex
and
hans
zimmer
music
have
in
common
you
can't
get
enough
of
either
of
them
there
is
one
big
difference
though
hans
zimmer
never
disappoints
you
i'm
so
friendzoned
that
often
when
she
and
i
go
out
to
eat
when
people
ask
if
we're
together
i
respond
she's
engaged
to
someone
else
okay

is
nutella

what
does
telling
on
a
student
cheating
do
for
you
what
others
do
won't
make
your
grade
any
better
study
hard
and
mind
your
business
8895
i
think
all
the
fighting
against
slut
shaming
is
stupid
if
a
girl
or
guy
is
the
kind
of
person
to
go
after
other
people's
significant
others
and
use
their
bodies
and
sex
to
get
what
they
want
in
life
should
we
all
be
up
in
arms
to
defend
them
that
behavior
is
morally
wrong
regardless
of
what
religion
if
at
all
one
chooses
to
practice
seems
like
the
urge
to
be
politically
correct
these
days
have
made
disliking
anything
or
any
activity
wrong

i
didn't

of
ribbons
on
her
chest
i
don't

what
class
year
she
is
but
she
had
a
black
belt
on
and
i
know
that
means
something
in
the
corps
she
was
really
cute
and
she
looked
like
she
was
on
a
mission
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
her
but
if
anybody
knows
her
can
they
tag
her

heartless

i
feel
bad
that
he
has
to
date
someone
as
worthless
as
you
and
that
you
go
to
cornell
it's
a
mark
of
shame
on
this
school
16555
it
seems
like
all
guys
over
here
are
only
interested
in
playing
games
and
getting
lucky
with
any
girl
what
does
a
girl
need
to
do
to
find
a
guy
who
genuinely
wants
her
and
her
only
or
am
i
just
being
too
naive
for
wanting
this
since
unh
locations
are
earning

feel
invincible
and
like
lifes
great
then
my
emotions
just
plummet
and
i'm
just
all
f
the
world
idk
i'm
usually
the
cheery
guy
making
others
feel
better
i
can
kinda
understand
what's
causing
it
but
its
complicated
and
i
think
i
can
wait
it
out
but
pressure
builds
up
and
pops
every
now
and
then
any
advice
3314
over
the
past
couple
years
patriotism
has
made
me
uneasy
i'd
like
to
think
i
am
a
citizen
of
earth
before
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
patriotism
just
seems
like
it
promotes
too
much
of
an
us
versus
them
mentality
anyone
else
agree
the
only
reason
girls
here
become
feminists
is
because
they
don't
get
that
dope
dick
i
mean
have
you
ever
come
across
a
hot
feminist
i
think
not
911
i
wish
all
of
the
freshmen
could
experience
what
i
experienced
during
the
2009
2010
school
year
that
was
probably
the
last
year
iv
really
lived
up
to
the
reputation
we
all
know
it
for
don't
get
me
wrong
iv's
still
a
blast
for
me
now
but
does
anybody
remember
those
bomb
ragers
they
used
to
have
on
el
nido
all
the
time
or
when
halloween
actually
drew
"50,000"
people
or
when
abrego
was
sketch
but
not
quite
that
sketch
man
i
feel
old
10710
to
the
person
who
stole
my
half
eaten
pad
thai
out
of
the
fridge
in
cook
whywouldyoudothat
also
i'm
sick
so
you
might
get
sick
sorry
but
you
shouldn't
have
eaten
my
pad
thai
2102
i'm
tired
of
being
rejected
i
put
myself
out
there
i
be
bold
and
tell
men
how
i
feel
so
why
am
i
always
turned
down
am
i
not
pretty
enough
am
i
too
much
of
the
good
friend
or
is
it
simply
because
i'm
the
type
of
girl
that
doesn't
give
it
up
so
easily
i'm
a
great
girl
just
take
the
time
to
get
to
know
me
re
guy
i
i
hope
i
am
the
girl
you're
thinking
of
i'm
not
a
bold
person
eitherbut
am
most
definitely
willing
to
reach
out
to
you
however
i
kind
of
need
to
know
if
you
are
the
the
guy
in
my
head
could
you
give
me
some
clues
maybe
say
when
how
we
met
i
suppose
i
could
tell
you
now
but
i'd
rather
wait
to
be
potentially
disappointed
if
it
turns
out
we're
wanting
to
know
different
people
girl
p.s
i
wouldn't
mind
persistence
from
you
i've
heard
that
the
drudge
report
is
based
at
texas
a
m
where
are
they
located
what
the
hell
is
a
nice
guy
i
feel
like
it's
just
someone
that
is
putting
on
a
fake
mask
to
talk
to
girls
smiling
and
saying
nice
things
to
a
girl
when
it's
completely
non
genuine
am
i
right
guy
11983
this
year
i
have
become
anorexic
and
bulimic
my
parents
have
noticed
my
weight
loss
and
are
making
me
go
to
an
11
hour
treatment
center
this
summer
or
they
wont
pay
for
college
i
have
an
incredible
once
in
a
lifetime
internship
set
up
for
this
summer
please
help
what
do
i
do
3228
to
the
creepy
ass
motherfucker
who
just
knocked
on
our
door
who
the
fuck
are
you
my
roommate
and
i
are
now
so
scared
we
are
laying
next
to
each
other
in
a
twin
size
bed
chances
are
you're
a
normal
georgetown
student
or
crazed
psycho
killer
but
its
not
okay
to
do
that
at
12
18
am
it
really
irritates
me
when
i
see
people
complaining
about
being
put
in
the
friendzone
even
though
they're
such
a
nice
person
etc
you
know
what
that
tells
me
you
aren't
mature
enough
for
a
relationship
just
being
a
nice
person
doesn't
mean
that
someone
else
has
to
like
you
and
when
you
whine
about
being
put
in
the
friendzone
it
means
you
aren't
thinking
about
what
the
other
person
needs
relationships
take
two
people
and
being
put
in
the
friendzone
means
the
other
person
wasn't
interested
for
whatever
reason
you
know
what
it
does
mean
it
means
you
just
got
a
new
friend
some
of
the
best
friends
i
have
even
better
friends
than
a
lot
of
the
guys
i
know
are
girls
that
put
me
in
the
friendzone
grow
up
realize
that
relationships
are
not
just
about
you
parties
are
stupid
parties
no
no
thank
you
i'm
not
about
that
crowd
hot
sweaty
drunk
people
grabbing
butts
that
aren't
theirs
to
grab
too
much
alcohol
for
so
many
underage
college
students
the
encouragement
of
getting
laid
by
frat
boys
cramped
spaces
smelling
like
alcohol
and
drugs
disgusting
frat
houses
that
look
like
they
could
double
as
meth
labs
no
no
thank
you
instead
of
dressing
up
or
more
like
dressing
like
a
slut
and
getting
wasted
or
effed
up
and
doing
things
you're
going
to
regret
and
most
likely
not
remember
tomorrow
i'd
rather
have
a
girls
night
in
with
my
best
guy
friends
nothing
like
food
movies
and
more
food
college
is
what
you
make
it
life
is
what
you
make
it
my
friends
you
only
get
to
live
once
so
don't
mess
it
up
remember
we
are
here
to
get
an
education

what
the
actual
fuck
nintendo
2321
was
at
a
community
fair
earlier
today
being
held
at
a
church
i
was
buying
a
burger
in
the
corner
of
the
fair
and
i
witnessed
a
kid
who
was
in
6th
or
7th
grade
walk
up
to
a
girl
i
presume
he
knew
her
she
looked
like
she
might
have
been
in
9th
grade
tops
and
threaten
to
cunt
punt
her
yes
you
read
that
correctly
turns
out
i'm
not
the
only
one
who
overheard
him
a
security
guard
walked
up
to
him
to
scold
him
about
it
the
kid
turned
to
the
security
guard
and
said
fuck
off
old
geezer
i
don't
have
to
fucking
listen
to
you
i
can
get
you
sent
to
prison
by
claiming
you
touched
me
sad
part
is
the
little
kid
is
right
one
sentence
and
a
fair
bit
of
acting
is
all
it
takes
to
ruin
that
man's
life
anywho
the
question
i
had
been
pondering
is
who
the
fuck
did
such
a
fantastically
shitty
job
raising
this
kid
and
lastly
fuck

so
whats
ur
introduction
these
lines
are
written
by
me
for
someone
is
it
nice
plz
suggest
11780
to
everyone
who
says
there's
an
unacceptable
amount
of
fat
shaming
on
campus
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
ok
please
take
a
good
look
at
your
own
behavior
about
other
eating
problems
how
many
times
have
you
looked
at
a
super
thin
girl
and
thought
that
she
could
use
a
sandwich
or
god
forbid
even
said
it
to
her
you're
fat
is
unacceptable
to
say
to
someone
while
you're
too
thin
for
some
reason
is
fine
you
can
pull
the
same
socioeconomic
reasons
for
being
too
thin
too
the
homeless
an
exaggerated
example
of
course
are
often
too
thin
undereating
is
as
much
a
self
control
problem
as
overeating
and
anorexia
and
bulimia
are
serious
medical
conditions
not
just
a
life
choice
those
disgusting
ads
of
skeletons
looking
in
the
mirror
and
seeing
a
plump
girl
that's
true
it's
an
actual
problem
in
the
way
we
perceive
ourselves
added
on
top
of
a
social
pressure
to
be
thin
no
kind
of
shaming
is
ok
just
don't
be
the
first
to
throw
a
stone
778
only
6
of
blacks
and
8
of
hispanics
attend
georgetown
compared
to
62
of
whites
i'm
pretty
sure
these
statistics
match
every
other
top
school
shutup
about
affirmative
action
as
if
its
this
uber
generous
policy
there
are
too
many
factors
that
go
into
accepting
a
student
anyway
outside
of
race
how
about
you
point
your
finger
at
legacy
students
with
mediocre
grades
instead
of
non
white
students
please
and
thank
you
someone
who
is
absolutely
tired
of
the
affirmative
action
posts
from
these
racist
whites
who
think
they
have
some
sort
of
entitlement
to
a
quality
education
in
case
you're
wondering
this
entire
country
is
skewed
towards
the
betterment
of
your
race
historically
and
even
now
sorry
if
non
whites
would
like
to
use
their
small
window
of
opportunity
to
better
themselves
get
a
grip
i
fully
support
and
think
that
gay
marriage
should
be
legalized
for
equality
reasons
yet
every
time
i
see
a
gay
couple
walking
around
together
i
cringe
inside
how
can
something
i
so
whole
heatedly
support
make
me
so
disgusted
does
this
make
me
a
hypocrite

hate

and
hating

of
it
how
do
you

feel
when
they
read
your
comment
keep
that
kinda
shit
to
yourself

hey
there
hot
european
boy
i've
been
checking
you
out
since
the
beginning
of
the
semester
your
penetrating
eyes
look
right
through
my
soul
your
soft
hair
shines
under
the
sun
your
skinny
jeans
show
your
perfect
bodyline
there
is
this
one
question
i've
been
dying
to
ask
are
you
gay
fyi
i'm
female
hey
ags
let's
get
something
started
here
i'm
tired
of
reading
boring
ass
posts
about
relationships
and
daddy
issues
and
troubles
with
boyfriends
it's
boring
and
doesn't
make
me
laugh
so
i
thought
we
could
do
something
to
change
things
up
let's
post
about
our
craziest
sex
stories
i'll
start
this
happened
to
me
last
weekend
i'm
dating
this
girl
from
my
hometown
who
used
to
work
with
me
it's
been
great
she's
funny
and
has
big
boobs
we've
been
dating
since
july
and
we're
already
in
a
sexual
relationship
of
course
because
really
if
you
date
a
girl
for
more
than
3
months
and
still
haven't
had
sex
with
her
you're
a
beta
and
you
should
kill
yourself
because
you're
a
bitch
anyway
so
last
week
she
came
over
to
my
place
and
things
started
to
get
hot
and
heavy
now
the
great
thing
about
my
girlfriend
is
that
with
her
blowjobs
are
not
a
rarity
and
it
has
been
bad
ass
that
night
i
was
expecting
one
but
she
changed
things
up
she
asked
me
to
go
down
on
her
i've
only
gone
down
on
a
woman
twice
in
my
life
and
both
times
were
very
unpleasant
you're
tongue
gets
tired
and
one
time
it
smelled
like
fish
shit
but
because
i'm
such
a
great
boyfriend
and
i
figured
i
owed
her
i
decided
to
take
one
for
the
team
so
i
go
down
there
and
it's
pretty
clean
it
doesn't
smell
bad
and
she's
trimmed
and
start
going
to
town
on
it
as
i
am
performing
my
tongue
starts
getting
tired
as
usual
but
i
persevere
and
then
i
notice
her
stomach
doing
some
weird
shit
it
was
moving
a
lot
and
convulsing
or
some
shit
and
i've
noticed
this
happening
before
during
sex
but
this
time
it
was
on
fucking
overdrive
she's
moaning
and
grabbing
on
to
the
bed
post
and
making
me
feel
like
a
true
bad
ass
but
then
something
happened
that
ruined
all
of
it
i'm
still
down
there
and
her
stomach's
still
doing
that
weird
convulsion
shit
and
then
out
of
nowhere
her
fucking
vagina
squirts
out
this
fucking
liquid
substance
all
over
my
face
and
mouth
all
of
my
pride
at
that
moment
was
shattered
i
was
disgusted
i
had
fucking
vagina
juice
all
over
my
face
and
in
my
fucking
mouth
now
through
my
extensive
viewing
of
pornography
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
have
squirted
i
always
thought
that
it
would
be
awesome
to
make
that
happen
it
was
one
of
my
many
sexual
fantasies
to
make
a
girl
do
that
but
at
that
moment
all
i
felt
was
disgust
and
hatred
how
the
fuck
do
i
know
she
didn't
just
piss
into
my
mouth
she
grabbed
me
and
kissed
me
and
told
me
it
was
amazing
and
i
pretended
to
be
happy
and
conceal
all
the
rage
and
shame
i'm
still
dating
her
but
i
will
never
go
down
on
her
again
and
if
she
asks
i'm
going
to
do
a
shitty
ass
job
now
to
all
of
you
women
who
are
going
to
comment
on
this
and
say
something
like
well
op
us
girls
get
your
jizz
on
us
when
we
give
you
bjs
and
we
don't
bitch
about
it
yeah
well
fuck
you
the
difference
is
that
it
is
expected
for
sperm
to
come
out
of
a
penis
you
anticipate
it
i
had
no
fucking
idea
i
was
about
to
get
doused
in
vagina
juice
alright
that's
my
story
let's
keep
this
going
ags
this
is
long
so
bear
with
me
i
need
some
help
advice
different
view
points
on
something
i'm
thinking
of
going
to
see
someone
else
about
this
to
see
how
to
figure
out
what
is
going
on
inside
my
head
but
i'm
really
just
confused
right
now
i
was
with
my
boyfriend
for
several
years
3
and
i
was
saving
myself
for
marriage
don't
get
me
wrong
i
wanted
to
have
sex
the
whole
relationship
it
was
my
faith
based
preference
that
prevented
me
from
doing
so
i
explained
to
him
my
sexual
reservations
and
the
reasons
behind
why
i
wanted
to
wait
we're
both
christian
and
we
came
to
an
agreement
that
once
we
had
a
ring
and
had
talked
to
my
parents
permission
old
fashioned
we
would
go
further
sexually
in
the
relationship
so
he
got
a
ring
and
we
set
a
date
for
our
engagement
he
was
a
planner
and
i
didn't
like
surprises
so
this
worked
out
really
well
and
we
talked
to
my
parents
a
few
weeks
pass
after
having
done
everything
and
he
breaks
things
off
online
at
that
and
you
can
say
the
sex
was
bad
or
make
a
joke
out
of
this
if
you
want
but
that
wasn't
the
case
at
all
if
anything
we
were
more
than
patient
with
each
other
on
that
i
realize
practice
makes
perfect
and
we
were
extremely
compatible
in
a
sexual
aspect
but
my
dilemma
is
that
i
gave
someone
something
that
i
was
saving
for
my
husband
did
i
love
him
yeah
but
i'm
kicking
myself
now
for
making
a
mistake
that
i
can't
undo
my
self
worth
self
esteem
is
at
an
all
time
low
i
had
hoped
that
after
three
years
of
being
happy
and
giving
him
everything
that
he
wouldn't
give
up
on
me
now
i
feel
extremely
naive
betrayed
and
worthless
i
need
help
i've
already
gone
to
scs
and
the
counselor
i
saw
seemed
to
only
parrot
things
back
to
me
that
i
said
and
tell
me
everything
i
want
to
hear
and
that's
not
what
i
need
i
need
someone
that
is
going
to
be
straight
with
me
and
not
tip
toe
around
my
feelings
thank
you
in
advance
why
is
walton
hall
gay
why
do
guys
automatically
look
over
girls
in
uniform
it
makes
those
of
us
who
just
want
to
be
normal
like
the
rest
of
you
feel
ashamed
of
the
uniform
we
wear
just
because
a
girl
is
in
the
corps
doesnt
make
her
any
less
of
a
girl
than
all
the
non
regs
walking
around
okay
i'm
a
freshman
girl
what's
the
easiest
way
to
get
alcohol
if
you're
under
aged
and
are
not
good
friends
with
many
people
who
are
21
also
where
are
the
best
parties
on
campus
like
how
would
i
got
about
getting
into
frat
parties
and
please
just
answer
my
question
like
i'm
an
aerospace
engineer
major
who
was
in
top
5
of
her
class
of
1000
so
i'm
not
gonna
go
fuck
myself
over
i'm
not
a
stupid
person
i'm
really
bored
of
the
same
old
routine
and
kinda
just
need
to
get
drunk
i'm
abroad
and
i
really
like
a
girl
back
at
school
she
seems
to
like
me
too
but
only
talks
to
me
sporadically
is
she
just
playing
me
should
i
stop
trying
5304
is
leonardo
dicaprio
seriously
playing
dr
martin
luther
king
jr
in
a
movie
fuck
this
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
a
man
of
color
will
be
able
to
play
me
in
a
movie
when
there
are
so
many
roles
out
there
for
leo
to
play
and
so
many
brilliant
black
actors
out
there
to
play
this
amazing
man
and
world
leader
how
can
we
do
this
it
feels
like
a
slap
in
the
face
5044
to
mac
mack
who
i
think
works
at
vittles
and
made
eye
contact
with
me
at
mug
in
icc
today
i
may
or
may
not
be
in
love
i
don't
mean
to
sound
desperate
or
thirsty
but
having
a
boyfriend
or
maybe
just
a
guy
friend
would
be
nice
right
now
i've
about
had
it
with
the
petty
dramatic
friendships
i've
been
enduring
i've
let
them
go
but
the
only
problem
is
i'm
pretty
much
lonely
all
the
time
how
can
i
get
over
my
awkwardness
and
how
do
i
make
guy
friends
cc
students
opinion
about
this
http
www.youtube.com
watch
v
443vy3i0gjs
i'm
just
curious
to
hear
and
understand
all
points
of
view
on
this
personally
i
think
it's
wonderful
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
why
someone
would
have
a
problem
with
it
but
for
those
who
disagree
i
would
love
to
know
understand
why
when
where
does
hips
meet
and
will
it
this
week
not
a
confession
but
i'm
excited
just
got
accepted
for
the
spring
semester
gig
em
what
does
an
incoming
female
transfer
student
who
is
already
familiar
with
a
m
need
to
know
my
first
reaction
to
getting
the
text
from
unh
that
a
car
was
stolen
there's
an
e
lot
why
are
people
so
against
no
strings
attached
relationships
obviously
the
people
judging
others
about
them
have
never
been
in
one
because
i
personally
think
they
are
the
best
kind
no
feelings
just
fun
no
jealousy
no
drama
well
atleast
for
the
most
part
if
you
actually
keep
it
the
way
its
supposed
to
be
i
mean
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
commitment
and
relationships
thats
very
respectable
but
at
this
age
i
would
rather
be
able
to
enjoy
the
company
of
someone
when
i
want
it
rather
than
feeling
like
i
need
to
see
them
all
the
time
and
tell
them
every
single
thing
i'm
doing
it
makes
me
sad
that
guys
at
cc
only
want
super
skinny
chicks
where
the
plus
sized
love
i
have
nothing
to
confess
i
just
don't
want
to
do
hw
study
did
you
know
there
are
more
atoms
in
a
cup
glass
of
water
than
there
are
cups
of
water
in
the
oceans
on
earth
i
hope
this
is
true.i
just
looked
up
mind
blowing
facts
back
to
hw
and
studying
this
sucks
i
hope
you
had
a
great
day
again
watch
this
whole
movie
before
you
open
your
mouth
then
try
and
say
the
damage
of
racism
against
whites
isn't
just
as
serious
as
the
damage
of
racism
against
blacks

cute
guy

should
say
to
whoever

my
door

midnight
without

and
proceeded
to

first

he
is

telling

blinds
next
time
girls

you
saw
a
shirtless
hot
guy
wouldn't
you
like
to
look
a
couple
more
times
this
guy
sounds
like
he's
insanely
cute
and
the
girl
is
very
brave
for
actually
wanting
to
meet
him
if
this
is
real
these
two
people
will
be
so
cute
together
i
know

is
all
you
people
think
about
is
sex
come
on
i'm
not
a
prude
but
danggggg
i'm
on
cornell
confessions
to
get
a
laugh
or
read
something
meaningful
if
you
had
to
describe
cc

in
5
words
what
would
they
be

i

it
both
pains
and
frustrates
me
when
i
hear
about
people
who
majored
in
such
things
as
art
history
or
english
being
surprised
when
nobody
wants
to
hire
them
upon
graduation
an
education
especially
one
you
spend
"200,000"
on
is
an
economic
investment
and
you
are
not
respecting
this
when
you
study
something
that
is
of
little
use
to
society
would
you
buy
a
house
that
you
can't
enter
or
a
car
without
an
engine
why
do
these
ivory
tower
liberal
studies
courses
even
exist
at
such
an
expensive
college
i
feel
that
cornell
is
partly
at
fault
for
setting
these
students
up
for
failure
with
such
policies
as
any
person
any
study
but
the
students
themselves
should
receive
the
majority
of
the
blame
by
not
recognizing
what
society
is
looking
for
in
an
employable
individual
disclaimers
this
problem
is
slightly
less
pronounced
at
cornell
because
of
our
perceived
prestige
if
you
happen
to
be
an
art
history
or
english
major
who
had
no
problem
in
the
job
market
congratulations
but
the
majority
of
your
peers
certainly
do
not
share
your
luck
i
write
as
an
stem
major
who
had
no
issue
getting
jobs
even
with
a
sub
par
gpa
no
internships
etc
admin
i
edited
your
quotations
i
imagine
you
decided
to
double
stack
them
to
add
emphasis
so
this
girl
what
can
i
say
we
have
such
similar
life
philosophies
even
when
we
differ
on
things
i
love
the
way
she
thinks
she
thinks
she
looks
like
a
nervous
wreck
but
i
find
elegance
in
her
simplicity
her
lack
of
vanity
i
would
seriously
marry
her
in
a
heartbeat
if
she
wanted
despite
my
ignorant
folly
of
married
life
i
would
try
my
best
to
make
it
work
because
it
would
feel
so
right
even
though
she
graduates
this
year
i
at
least
want
her
to
realize
she
was
loved
while
at
rice
but
if
i
tell
her
would
it
break
our
friendship
and
destroy
a
connection
that
i
find
precious
oh
there's
another
problem
she's
muslim
and
i
am
not
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
it
at
all
i
would
convert
naturally
but
i
feel
she
would
take
issue
or
her
family
would
there's
going
to
be
a
torturous
inner
battle
raging
in
me
for
the
next
two
months
but
in
the
end
guys
how
can
us
girls
make
the
first
move
do
you
like
it
when
we
do
i
just
wanna
show
you
i
want
ya
2607
i
know
that
being
in
a
relationship
might
seem
like
a
huge
deal
right
now
but
let's
think
about
prom
back
in
highschool
finding
the
perfect
prom
date
has
a
big
ass
deal
many
waited
around
for
the
perfect
guy
to
ask
us
out
or
we
grew
the
balls
to
ask
the
girl
you've
been
crushing
on
for
years
although
many
of
us
managed
to
get
a
date
a
big
part
were
disappointed
and
heartbroken
now
what
well
you
gathered
a
group
of
friends
and
you
went
to
prom
danced
all
night
and
had
a
blast
college
is
the
same
thing
some
of
us
might
find
love
some
might
have
fun
just
for
one
night
but
all
of
us
will
find
great
people
that
will
get
us
through
tough
times
and
we
will
have
the
best
years
of
our
lives
don't
give
up
just
yet

i
don't
get
it
if
the
corp
is
recognizing
that
many
people
think
their
coffee
taste
like
shit
why
don't
they
address
these
comments
or
take
the
initiative
to
improve
their
coffee
if
corp
storefronts
weren't
so
conveniently
close
personally
i
would
not
consider
buying
coffee
there
your
prices
are
not
that
much
cheaper
than
other
places
corp
please
get
off
your
perceived
high
horse
and
reconsider
the
quality
of
your
ingredients
it's
4am
now
and
i
should
really
go
to
bed
but
i
felt
this
needed
some
immediate
attention
why
are
people
so
prejudiced
towards
racists
why
can't
we
just
believe
what
we
want
to
without
anyone
giving
us
crap
about
it

i
second
guess
if
i
really
was
meant

be

days
i
feel
great

other
i
feel
like
i
am
the
stupidest
person
in
the
world
i
try
to
have
a
life
as
well
but
it
seems
i
have
to
be
a
lab
rat
and
be
buried
in
papers
and
books

just
to
compete
with
the
nerdy
kid
who
gives
snide
remarks
with
a
really
you
didn't
know
that
tone
to
other
classmates
for
saying
anything
marginally
incorrect
being
at
cornell
is
just
a
constant
competition
to
take
down
your
fellow
scholars
right
until
you
get
into
grad
school
then
everyone
is
all
smiles
and
buddy
buddy
why
are
people
complaining
about
too
many
confessions
guess
people
will
always
find
a
way
to
complain
i
just
added
everyone
who
commented
or
liked
my
confession
i
think
we
should
turn
this
into
a
game
adds
a
little
danger
to
the
page
don't
think
i
really
hope
i'm
not
the
only
one
who
works
until
5
am
or
later
sometimes
it
always
feels
like
i
am
sometimes
though
it
doesn't
even
feel
that
wrong
or
uncomfortable
until
people
say
they
could
never
do
that
i
could
never
get
my
work
done
on
a
normal
schedule
though
what's
wrong
with
me
who
is
the
gorgeous
blonde
freshman
lady
who
studies
in
the
library
every
afternoon
8607
the
blonde
and
the
peeper
it
sounds
like
a
fable
can
somebody
go
screenshot
all
the
relevant
posts
so
we
can
see
the
progression
why
is
it
that
the
the
people
who
have
the
hardest
time
parking
in
between
the
damn
lines
in
the
garages
drive
the
smallest
cars
seriously
if
i
can
fit
my
big
ass
f250
perfectly
into
that
space
you
should
be
able
to
park
your
little
hyundai
in
between
the
lines
without
me
having
to
worry
about
dinging
your
fucking
door
if
you're
the
owner
of
a
small
vehicle
and
you've
done
a
shitty
parking
job
right
next
to
me
that
pretty
much
fucks
me
over
from
trying
to
get
out
then
don't
be
surprised
when
you
come
back
and
find
the
entire
side
of
your
car
keyed
this
applies
in
particular
to
the
owner
of
the
new
corolla
that
couldn't
get
their
shit
together
tonight
and
has
a
surprise
waiting
for
them
a
truck
owner
who
can
actually
park
between
the
goddamn
lines
p.s
if
i'm
backing
out
of
a
spot
that
you
want
so
dearly
wait
like
a
normal
person
don't
run
up
on
my
ass
and
then
wonder
why
my
towing
ball
has
conveniently
decided
to
destroy
your
car's
front
end
what
are
your
thoughts
on
students
who
still
wear
hollister
and
abercrombie
i
understand
people
wearing
them
if
they
are
left
over
from
high
school
maybe
so
they
don't
have
to
buy

douchey
vibe

hayley

i
was
just
wondering
if
you
wanted
to
go
to
the
yule
ball
with
me
18600
some
of
my
friends
just
uploaded
their
photos
from
the
chi
alpha
and
cru
christmas
parties
dammit
why
are
all
the
christian
girls
so
cute
hey
guys
insert
random
movie
line
here
can
i
have
likes
please
if
my
sex
life
were
a
kitchen
appliance
immersion
blender
i
just
don't
really
get
turned
on
often
but
when
i
do
it's
for
something
special
whenever
i'm
meeting
getting
to
know
better
a
guy
one
of
my
most
important
questions
is
have
you
read
the
harry
potter
books
if
the
answer
is
no
i
am
immediately
turned
off
272
9
hours
till
my
first
final
who's
with
me
fellow
ags
does
size
really
matter
i
dread
going
home
to
my
mom
during
the
holidays
she
provides
everything
for
me
she
works
hard
for
me
she
pays
for
my
rent
my
utilities
and
my
food
but
throughout
my
life
she
has
taken
an
emotional
toll
on
me
we
used
to
have
everything
my
mom
was
successful
private
practice
attorney
in
houston
she
owned
4
different
rental
properties
along
with
our
"3,000"
square
foot
home
we
had
3
cars
including
a
mercedes
benz
i
had
a
texas
tomorrow
fund
college
savings
account
that
i
knew
about
since
i
was
about
6
years
old
as
far
as
i
knew
i
was
set
in
the
winter
of
2004
my
mom
announced
to
me
that
she
would
be
closing
her
private
practice
and
seeking
a
job
with
the
government
i
didn't
think
much
of
it
at
the
time
fast
fast
forward
to
my
senior
year
of
high
school
we
were
living
in
a
2
bed
room
apartment
with
1
car
shopping
at
the
dollar
store
but
thats
not
as
bad
as
what
i'm
about
to
tell
you
the
most
egregious
thing
my
mother
cashed
out
my
texas
tomorrow
college
savings
fund
and
spent
it
all
my
college
fund
my
fucking
college
fund
i
don't
know
where
that
money
went
now
i
have
about
"25,000"
in
student
loans
all
because
my
mom
has
terrible
fucking
foresight
and
thought
that
i
wasn't
going
to
go
to
college
i
admit
i
was
a
bit
of
a
fuck
up
but
did
she
really
think
that
low
of
me
that
she
had
to
cash
out
the
thing
that
would
allow
me
to
go
to
school
debt
free
but
thats
just
the
start
of
the
train
wreck
that
is
my
mother
and
i's
relationship
i
hardly
ever
speak
when
i'm
around
her
i'm
always
so
afraid
that
i
might
say
something
that
will
give
her
an
excuse
to
yell
at
me
or
criticize
when
she
brings
me
around
her
friends
she
always
says
something
that
isn't
true
about
me
like
for
example
a
common
thing
is
for
my
mom's
friends
to
ask
if
i'm
dating
or
engaged
i'll
say
no
quietly
but
she'll
say
he's
waiting
until
he
graduates
or
something
along
those
lines
thats
not
true
i'm
actively
seeking
relationships
in
fact
i
had
coffee
with
a
girl
the
other
day
which
is
a
good
segway
into
my
next
point
i'm
afraid
that
if
i
get
a
girlfriend
and
it
comes
to
a
point
where
we
meet
each
other's
parents
that
my
mom
will
get
upset
because
i'm
dating
a
white
girl
i'm
half
black
half
mexican
she
has
expressed
her
disapproval
of
the
idea
of
me
dating
a
white
girl
she
has
said
things
like
you
can
drive
white
cars
but
you
can't
bring
home
white
girls
this
is
really
concerning
to
me
see
although
i'm
brown
i'm
basically
an
oreo
brown
on
the
outside
white
on
the
inside
throughout
my
life
all
my
best
friends
have
been
white
so
i'm
most
comfortable
around
white
people
and
i
envision
myself
marrying
a
white
girl
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
fact
that
because
i
do
have
such
a
tough
relationship
with
my
mother
that
my
ideal
girl
a
girl
who
values
family
a
lot
will
think
less
of
me
because
of
that
i
dont
know
what
to
do
and
i
start
to
think
about
these
things
especially
around
the
holidays
when
i
have
to
go
back
to
her
and
everyone
else
with
what
seems
to
be
a
great
relationship
with
both
their
parents
goes
back
home
and
i
also
think
about
the
relationship
with
my
mom
think
about
getting
married
i
like
the
idea
of
getting
married
but
i
also
think
about
the
intricacies
that
lead
up
to
marriage
which
include
meeting
the
future
in
laws
what
day
is
it
hump
daayyyyyyy
12775
to
the
girls
in
noyes
who
had
this
conversation
girl

why
would
anyone
buy
and
eat
a
candy
bar
who
does
that
i've
never
bought
a
candy
bar
before
oh
i
know
who
would
buy
a
candy
bar
girl
2
yeah
and
a
whole
pint
of
ben
and
jerry's
too
not
only
are
you
incredibly
stupid
but
you
are
also
extremely
condescending
and
rude
that
is
all
also
it's
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
air
out
all
your
relationship
problems
in
public
you
obviously
don't
love
your
boyfriend
18721
i
am
on
the
verge
of
failing
2
classes
fml
i
just
started
my
edu
at
cornell
what
is
this
its
not
like
im
f
cking
around
im
trying
really
hard
ugh
the
extreme
depression
im
going
to
get
soon
will
be
brutal
9680
i
haven't
fallen
in
love
with
or
even
liked
anyone
since
2010
yes
he
was
my
first
love
and
it
was
intense
but
isn't
it
time
now
does
it
brother
anyone
else
that
easter
sunday
is
4
20
as
a
two
time
advisor
once
co
once
at
my
own
college
i
can
honestly
say
o
week
culture
is
fucking
annoying
you're
not
my
babies
and
i'm
not
your
father
i
just
want
to
be
your
friend
dammit
stop
turning
this
into
some
cutesy
over
the
top
family
thing
can't
we
just
hang
out
i
have
the
biggesttttttt
crush
on
the
student
body
president
does
anyone
know
if
he's
single
how
i
can
meet
him
does
adam
f
press
think
they
can
turn
down
their
music
in
the
cardio
room
i
have
noise
canceling
headphones
and
it's
hard
to
block
out
whatever
music
is
currently
being
blasted
without
turning
my
music
all
the
way
up
to
counter
it's
not
that
i
don't
like
the
music
the
employees
choose
to
play
but
everyone
likes
to
work
out
to
their
own
music
their
own
tempo
that's
understandable
right
sorority
girls
don't
completely
suck
they're
just
very
very
cliquish
my
best
friend
is
not
the
same
after
she
became
friends
with
them
all
she
lives
with
some
and
whenever
i
go
visit
they
don't
even
talk
to
me
even
though
we've
hung
out
a
lot
i
feel
like
it
s
a
competition
all
of
the
time
when
my
friend
wears
long
shirts
they
celebrate
seriously
who
does
that
fat
jokes
can
be
funny
sometimes
but
there's
a
huge
difference
between
joking
about
someone's
weight
and
berating
someone
about
their
weight
see
how
easy
that
was
a
lot
of
times
different
meds
or
hormone
changes
can
mess
with
your
weight
so
it'd
be
great
if
people
on
here
could
think
before
crushing
someone's
self
esteem
oh
yeah
inb4
assuming
op
is
fat
what's
your
secret

why
do
you
people
care
if
sorority
girls
wear
big
shirts
who
fucking
cares
it's
clothes
people
are
wearing
to
class
and
probably
don't
care
about
impressing
people
i
think
chacos
are
disgusting
but
i
never
bitch
about
it
like
you
people
so
sorority
girls
do
yo
thang
there's
one
sound
no
one
knows
what
does
the
aggie
say
506
i
have
fucked
in
many
academic
buildings
where
do
people
have
sex
in
lau
i
want
to
add

dear
nick
on
the
baseball
team
did
it
hurt
when
you
fell
from
heaven
sincerely
everyone
do
guys
really
like
curvy
girls
they
say
they
do
but
i
have
yet
to
witness
it
3174
in
all
seriousness
can
someone
please
tell
me
how
a
girl
showing
full
cleavage
is
not
essentially
the
same
as
a
guy
wearing
his
junk
out
and
how
staring
is
not
to
be
expected
because
it's
totally
out
of
the
ordinary
maybe
i'll
start
walking
with
my
dick
out
so
i
can
start
yelling
hey
i
never
asked
for
this
so
much
oppression
things
just
aren't
going
as
well
as
i
hoped
they
would
and
living
the
air
force
life
for
a
few
years
and
then
returning
to
school
just
seems
like
my
best
option
my
dad
has
saved
for
years
to
send
my
siblings
and
i
to
college
it's
his
dream
to
have
a
child
graduate
from
a
m
and
it's
my
dream
to
graduate
from
a
m
so
i'm
scared
that
when
i
talk
to
my
parents
about
it
over
spring
break
i'm
worried
that
he's
just
going
to
completely
shut
me
down
and
not
support
me
in
what
i
want
to
do
how
do
i
tell
my
parents
mainly
my
dad
that
i
want
to
quit
school
for
a
few
years
without
him
going
ballistic
and
getting
pissed
off
at
me
for
god
knows
how
long
warning
paragraph
ahead
my
ex
and
i
had
a
problem
when
we
were
together
because
he
was
jealous
of
me
hanging
out
with
other
guys
yet
he
always
hung
out
with
other
girls
and
seemed
to
be
a
constant
flirt
he
would
even
get
tutoring
or
study
with
other
girls
when
we
had
the
same
class
and
i
started
to
get
the
feeling
he
was
cheating
he
denied
having
any
intentions
other
than
being
friendly
but
it
definitely
didn't
seem
that
way
we
broke
up
and
afterwards
i
wrote
it
off
as
me
just
being
hypocritical
and
overly
jealous
even
though
he
tried
to
move
on
pretty
fast
anyways
onto
the
main
point
my
ex
now
has
a
new
girl
the
thing
is
as
a
third
party
now
he
still
seems
to
flirt
with
a
lot
of
girls
despite
being
taken
also
we
went
to
the
same
event
recently
and
after
his
girl
left
he
was
all
cozied
up
to
another
chick
i'm
starting
to
wonder
if
my
previous
assumptions
that
he's
not
exactly
the
faithful
type
are
true
should
i
tell
his
new
girl
i
feel
like
i
would
have
liked
to
know
but
i
don't
want
to
be
that
ex
i
like
you
still
you
don't
like
me
you're
looking
for
a
relationship
and
its
waiting
for
you
right
here
6069
met
a
cute
guy
at
a
party
last
weekend
i
think
you
were
a
flute
but
i
didn't
really
get
to
talk
to
you
and
i
was
high
as
f
lol
anyway
hit
me
up
self
flushing
urinals
are
the
bane
of
my
existence
does
anyone
remember
the
good
ol
days
where
we
had
a
sense
of
community
a
sense
of
brotherhood
what
happened
to
going
to
use
the
bathroom
to
see
the
last
12
people
before
you
hadn't
flushed
an
unspoken
agreement
between
peers
to
overfill
the
urinal
through
hard
work
alone
working
together
without
ever
meeting
or
speaking
to
each
other
so
that
one
day
one
man
would
be
lucky
enough
to
add
the
last
ounce
of
urine
to
watch
it
overflow
i
was
never
any
of
these
men
but
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
lucky
ones
i
frown
for
future
generations
who
will
never
have
this
feeling
of
belonging
and
trust
let's
work
together
to
rid
this
country
of
automatic
urinals
lets
take
back
our
land
and
give
a
brighter
future
to
the
children
of
today

tonight
i
was
attacked
for
wearing
a
communist
symbol
in
representation
of
solidarity
not
only
was
i
called
un
american
but
i
was
compared
to
representing
ideals
represented
by
the
nazis
when
did
georgetown
get
like
this
open
discussion
and
free
speech
are
only
available
when
people
do
not
attack
each
other
for
their
views
also
comparing
something
you
don't
like
to
hitler
the
nazis
or
the
swastika
is
incredibly
ignorant
communism
is
in
no
way
perfect
but
to
personally
attack
someone
who
sees
the
merit
in
its
theory
by
likening
them
to
hitler
is
naive
childish
and
hateful

i
don't
think
anyone
should
be
allowed
to
have
guns
if
you
want
to
practice
at
a
shooting
range
hunt
or
something
the
guns
should
all
be
locked
up
somewhere
and
left
there
if
you
argue
for
protection
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
the
instances
where
owning
a
gun
was
beneficial
in
protection
has
been
outweighed
significantly
in
the
deaths
it
has
caused
accidental
or
not
also
the
number
of
deaths
caused
by
handguns
is
much
greater
than
automatic
or
semi
automatic
firearms
tasers
and
pepper
spray
however
i
do
believe
should
be
allowed
for
protection
purposes
if
only
this
were
realistic
fact
i
am
a
guy
i
never
had
sex
1
question
should
i
or
not
say
that
i
never
had
sex
to
girls
i
usually
prefer
to
be
honest
but
i
am
not
sure
about
this
i
resent
boys
who
try
to
hold
doors
open
for
me
do
you
think
i
can't
do
it
myself

gaslighting
i
don't

who
i

or
what
i
should
do
with
my
life
i
don't
know
how
to
take
care
of
myself
i
don't
trust
my
own
emotions
and
judgments
i'm
not
capable
of
contributing
anything
to
society
there
must
be
a
reason
why
they
treated
me
like
i
was
crazy
there
must
be
something
to
it
i'm
useless
i'm
stupid

useless
and
that
makes
me
vulnerable

i
need
someone
to

if

have
a
dream
that
one
day
women
will
not

on

i
have
a
dream

have
a
dream

doing
something
right

she's
clean

just

i
honestly
don't

if
i
can

tomorrow
why

i
wasting
my
opportunity
at
an
education
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
page
during
the
summer
i
fucked
a
nun
today
i
don't
intend
to
be
in
a
relationship
with
her
it
was
more
like
a

bad
that

ain't
a
nun
no

brewster

is
a
little
old
for
me
but
maybe
i
could
make
an
exception
if
you
weren't
seeing
someone
i
am
a

don't
know
how
to
prove
that
but
i
have
decided
that
this
will
be
my
last
post
to
you
for
now
though
i'll
occasionally
write
some
incase
you
want
to
read
my
words
p
if
you
wish
me
to
use
more
profanity
like
usual
i
will
but
i
was
accused
of
being
a
man
for
writing
so
profanely
what
can
i
say
though
i
am
just
a
profane
girl
for
the
right
guy
anyway
good
bye

now

wow
okay
i
wasn't
sure
if
i
was
ever
going
to
tell
anyone
about
this
but
it's
late
and
i'm
sleep
deprived
so
i
guess
i'll
just
write
it
now
and
regret
it
in
the
morning
first
of
all
just
for
some
background
my
mom
died
right
when
i
was
born
she
was
actually
really
really
hot
but
this
isn't
about
her
i
guess
that's
messed
up
to
say
but
whatever
i
actually
grew
up
with
my
dad's
family
because
my
dad
has
all
sorts
of
emotional
issues
and
he
bailed
before
i
was
born
so
you
can
see
my
childhood
was
really
kind
of
messed
up
anyways
growing
up
i
feel
like
there
was
always
a
lot
of
distance
between
me
and
my
sister
when
i
was
about
17
or
18
i
first
noticed
that
my
sister
was
a
hottie
i
don't
want
to
go
into
to
many
details
about
it
but
basically
what
happened
is
that
i
accidentally
found
a
video
that
she
made
of
herself
i
knew
she
didn't
make
it
for
me
but
i
thought
she
was
so
beautiful
that
i
watched
it
twice
probably
would
have
watched
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
except
that
like
right
around
the
time
i
found
the
video
all
this
crazy
went
down
and
i
had
to
leave
home
my
dad's
family
who
i
was
staying
with
got
in
bad
trouble
with
the
law
i
never
talk
about
it
sooo
i
was
totally
lusting
after
my
sister
at
that
point
she
was
also
having
bad
trouble
with
the
law
she
was
actually
in
custody
when
i
left
home
my
friend
and
i
went
to
go
pick
her
up
when
i
saw
her
that
day
after
seeing
the
video
i
have
to
be
honest
i
just
wanted
to
frak
her
brains
out
looking
back
on
it
now
it's
pretty
messed
up
but
i
think
she
had
feelings
for
me
too
she
actually
kissed
me
right
after
we
came
to
get
her
and
it
wasn't
a
sisterly
kiss
you
know
i
mean
it
wasn't
like
ridiculously
sexual
or
anything
but
it
definitely
wasn't
sisterly
after
we
left
we
all
went
to
crash
with
my
sister's
friends
on
the
trip
there
my
friend
sort
of
implied
that
he
wanted
to
get
with
my
sister
and
i
got
a
little
jealous
he's
a
good
looking
guy
and
even
though
she
was
my
sister
i
just
felt
like
he
was
competition
not
much
else
happened
between
us
for
a
while
except
some
maybe
sexy
hugging
pretty
much
everyone
in
my
life
at
that
point
was
wanted
by
the
government
so
we
all
moved
around
a
lot
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
proud
of
it
or
anything
but
it
was
kind
of
an
awesome
time
my
friend
and
my
sister
never
hooked
up
i
don't
think
but
i
thought
there
was
some
serious
sexual
tension
going
on
between
them
it
was
around
that
time
that
i
got
really
badly
hurt
in
an
accident
it
was
messed
up
i
almost
died
but
when
i
was
in
recovery
my
sister
came
to
see
me
and
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky
she
started
gives
me
this
awesome
slow
passionate
kiss
on
the
lips
sadly
although
i
guess
for
the
best
nothing
ever
came
of
it
we
spent
some
time
apart
and
i
started
to
get
really
religious
so
i
tried
not
to
think
of
her
that
way
it
was
actually
going
well
for
a
long
time
like
i
was
totally
over
her
but
i
have
to
say
like
a
year
or
so
after
all
that
stuff
went
down
we
were
out
sailing
not
like
a
date
or
anything
romantic
like
that
and
she
was
wearing
like
the
hottest
bikini
i've
ever
seen
and
it
brought
back
all
the
old
feelings
sigh
a
little
while
later
she
actually
wound
up
with
my
friend
from
before
the
sexual
tension
guy
i
can't
say
i
was
surprised
but
even
after
she
was
shacking
up
with
my
friend
there
was
one
time
we
were
at
a
party
my
friend
was
inside
and
my
sister
and
i
were
outside
alone
it
was
a
really
intimate
moment
i
think
something
might
have
happened
except
that
i
killed
the
mood
when
i
told
her
that
darth
vader
was
our
father
and
that
i
had
to
go
face
him

to
the
person
who
sat
in
thursday's
educ
2710
class
weaving
no
one
minds
if
that
helps
you
concentrate
so
you
keep
going
through
the
class
discussion
occasionally
stopping
to
take
notes
if
we
ever
have
a
discussion
about
something
with
the
gravitas
of
9

again
however
would
you
kindly
stop
for
a
minute
i
cannot
fathom
how
you
can
be
so
disrespectful
to
your
classmates
discussing
what
happened
in
their
schools
on
that
day
the
person
describing
the
panic
from
their
school
2
blocks
away
for
goodness
sake
someone
was
telling
the
class
about
her
mother
who
survived
from
having
been
in
one
of
the
towers
please
just
think
next
time
your

can
wait

minutes
my

impressed

hate
how

use
dumbbells
to
tone
my
arms
and
when
i
walk
over

some
it's
like
every
guy
stares
at

like

the
issue

so
protective
of
that
side
of
the

to
the
gorgeous
card
swiper
at
helen
newman
you
left
me
speechless
are
you
seriously
that
perfect
unf
people
esp
freshmen
should
probably
check
themselves
real
quick
before
posting
their
grades
gpa
as
a
status
before
portraying
yourself
as
some
kind
of
model
un
super
child
please
remember
that
the
world
is
large
and
you
are
small
ask
yourself
what
am
i
trying
to
gain
from
college
and
reconsider
your
priorities
anyone
here
in
theta
tau
do
they
like
to
party
and
drink
like
the
other
fraternities
about
a
week
ago
my
best
friend
from
highschool
middle
school
and
elementary
school
who
has
never
told
a
lie
told
me
that
when
he
was
a
young
kid
he
could
move
objects
with
his
mind
he
also
told
me
that
he
told
his
dad
about
it
10
years
later
by
that
time
he
could
no
longer
do
it
and
his
dad
said
that
he
and
his
twin
brother
were
able
to
do
it
as
well
when
they
were
younger
i
know
his
dad
well
he
is
a
bluecollar
type
and
would
never
joke
about
shit
like
that
his
dad
also
said
that
he
developed
astral
projection
for
a
short
time
his
dad
went
on
to
say
its
funny
that
you
were
the
one
who
could
move
objects
because
your
half
brother
is
the
one
that
came
to
me
5
years
ago
saying
he
had
astral
projections
keep
in
mind
that
these
people
are
catholic
conservative
and
aren't
the
type
to
believe
in
stupid
shit
they
aren't
druggies
and
i
have
never
heard
them
tell
a
lie
so
i
actually
believe
them
100
and
am
now
questioning
everything
i
have
been
taught
in
my
life
is
this
magic
or
some
actual
technology
or
energy
that
we
have
discovered
or
forgotten
i
believe
that
people's
imaginations
are
always
based
on
things
that
they
have
seen
or
experienced
for
instance
imagine
and
animal
or
being
i
bet
you
that
every
feature
of
that
made
up
animal
is
actually
a
part
of
another
being
or
animal
so
for
that
reason
i
believe
that
witchcraft
and
shit
back
in
the
day
may
have
actually
be
a
real
thing
or
energy
that
people
harnassed
we
have
just
forgotten
that
technology
or
it
is
less
common
and
looked
down
upon
because
it
is
so
hard
to
handle
for
instance
how
were
the
pyramids
built
i
heard
an
expert
say
that
if
they
were
to
have
been
built
in
the
20
years
that
they
were
reportedly
completed
they
would
have
had
to
made
moved
and
placed
one
of
those
2
ton
blocks
every
2.5
minutes
first
of
all
with
the
technology
they
allegedly
had
they
would
have
barely
been
able
to
move
any
block
if
at
all
but
i
think
they
had
a
technology
or
skill
that
we
have
forgotten
or
alien
intervention
or
both
so
i
ask
you
guys
what
are
your
opinions
on
these
things
and
did
any
of
you
guys
ever
have
any
legitimate
powers
don't
bullshit
i
swear
2
weeks
ago
i
would
never
have
believed
you
2587
i
have
no
problem
with
the
presence
of
alcohol
and
i
drink
at
parties
but
sometimes
it
feels
like
alcohol
is
the
event
for
a
lot
of
people
i'm
not
saying
anybody
should
give
up
drinking
if
they
enjoy
it
but
the
the
first
thing
you
ask
your
friend
when
they
invite
you
somewhere
on
a
saturday
night
shouldn't
be
is
there
going
to
be
enough
beer
hey
brewmaster
i
heard
your
bday
is
this
weekend
congrats
so
how
did
the
pyramids
get
built
1682
what
ever
happened
to
the
segway
kid
12283
i
really
like
this
guy
in
the
same
professional
frat
as
me
but
i
don't
want
to
explicitly
ask
for
his
number
how
do
i
ask
without
sounding
like
a
creep
why
is
it
every
time
i
go
out
on
a
date
and
they
find
out
i'm
an
atheist
it
stops
being
a
date
and
becomes
an
attempt
to
convert
me
that
or
the
girl
becomes
cold
towards
me
does
my
lack
of
religion
really
bother
people
that
much
soo
i
may
have
lost
a
lil
pouch
containing
about
a
quarter
sheet
of
lsd
and
a
sizable
jar
of
dmt
be
on
the
lookout
i
guess
not
expecting
to
see
it
ever
again
but
i
suppose
someone
is
going
to
have
a
damn
good
day
soon
would
humans
be
considered
man
made
or
natural
how
do
i
make
friends
here
i
want
to
party
but
i
feel
like
i
have
no
one
to
go
with
5325
georgetown
housing
operations
facilities
get
your
fucking
shit
together
before
i
sue
you
for
negligence
and
failure
to
provide
safe
buildings
that
don't
have
fire
alarms
going
off
twice
everyday
it's
been
over
a
week
and
you
still
can't
fix
it
interrupting
my
sleep
several
times
a
week
is
fucking
with
my
school
shit
come
fucking
on
you
guys
are
pathetic
4047
guys
what
do
you
do
when
you're
unsure
as
to
whether
or
not
a
girl
whom
you're
interested
in
likes
you
how
do
you
find
out
if
she
does
or
not
thanks
curiosity
at
a
bar
i
always
be
like
should
i
ask
that
girl
out
or
not
not
like
i'm
less
of
a
man
or
i
don't
like
her
as
much
its
just
that
i'm
afraid
that
what
if
she
says
can
you
get
me
a
free
shot
there
was
this
girl
who
i
found
out
liked
me
she
had
a
boyfriend
at
the
time
so
i
didn't
make
any
moves
towards
her
i
was
waiting
for
her
to
tell
me
when
she
broke
up
with
him
then
id
make
my
move
and
go
slow
with
our
relationship
but
then
came
this
other
guy
who
had
been
friends
with
her
for
a
while
and
within
a
week
had
her
as
his
girlfriend
the
worst
thing
was
that
he
happened
to
be
leaving
for
the
military
and
wouldn't
be
back
for
a
year
or
so
i
was
like
wtf
your
just
going
to
forget
me
that
fast
i
talked
to
her
about
it
and
she
said
that
if
we
dated
then
broke
up
our
friendship
would
be
awkward
she
also
said
that
she
wanted
to
remain
close
friends
i
took
her
close
friends
skit
and
tried
to
work
with
it
until
yet
again
another
guy
started
at
work
this
guy
it
seems
took
my
place
as
the
close
friend
as
now
they
hang
out
all
the
time
and
talk
all
the
time
i
just
want
to
know
from
some
girls
why
would
you
do
that
to
a
guy
are
all
of
you
like
this
if
that
girl
is
reading
this
then
note
this
you
used
to
be
a
close
friend
and
you
would've
been
my
first
girlfriend
and
i
wanted
to
be
close
friends
again
but
i
see
you
have
replaced
me
for
two
guys
one
to
be
your
boyfriend
and
one
to
be
your
best
friend
i
guess
i
didn't
really
matter
in
your
eyes
so
i
guess
its
goodbye
just
know
that
i
will
always
remember
even
if
you
dont
10361
at
home
i
can
leave
the
windows
open
at
night
and
hear
the
peaceful
sounds
of
crickets
and
frogs
and
cicadas
here
it's
all
drunkards
all
the
time
can't
you
all
give
it
a
rest
who
thought
night
exams
were
a
good
idea
no
one
wants
to
be
in
a
lecture
hall
at
10
pm
is
this
accurate
confess
your
secrets
on
the
whisper
app
https
bitly.com
19ldu1e
here's
my
confession
all
my
life
i
have
really
really
wanted
to
be
a
disney
princess
great
hair
can
sing
and
always
marries
a
hot
guy
i
mean
is
that
too
much
to
ask
for
don't
worry
i'm
a
girl
lol
i
recently
told
my
guy
friend
that
i
had
feelings
for
him
but
he
told
me
he
didn't
feel
the
same
way
i
was
devastated
and
my
confidence
is
at
an
all
time
low
now
how
can
i
bounce
back
from
this
rejection
why
do
people
drive
around
in
lifted
pickup
trucks
with
huge
mud
tires
fancy
rims
and
bull
bars
when
their
truck
doesn't
even
have
4
wheel
drive
the
huge
lift
makes
it
obvious
to
see
that
there
is
no
front
differential
slapping
a
z71
sticker
or
fx4
sticker
on
the
truck
does
not
make
it
4
wheel
drive
i
mean
with
the
money
you
spent
on
all
your
accessories
you
probably
could
have
just
bought
an
actual
4x4
truck
instead
makes
no
sense
to
me
4117
girls
usually
love
attention
they
try
to
gain
attention
by
wearing
make
up
yoga
pants
and
what
not
why
don't
they
just
play
some
video
games
girls
if
you
decide
to
play
some
black
ops

every
guy
on
this
planet
will
instalove
you
that's
right

sometimes
after
i've
masturbated
myself
to
an
awesome
and
much
needed
orgasm
i'm
walking
around
campus
and
i
feel
like
all
the
guys
are
staring
and
shooting
me
smiles
is
that
my
brain
being
paranoid
or
do
i
have
a
hormonal
aura
that
they
gravitate
to
or
am
i
glowing
9954
i
wonder
our
crazy
almost
relationship
would
have
ever
worked
out
even
though
you're
a
junior
in
du
and
i'm
a
freshman
i'm
oddly
afraid
of
knocking
over
the
entire
bowl
of
croutons
in
hoco
anyone
else
can
people
not
sound
stupid
by
ending
their
posts
with
sorry
but
it's
true
when
you
clearly
aren't
sorry
at
all
i
doubt
you
managed
to
type
and
submit
your
entire
secret
with
so
much
guilt
brewing
inside
you
you
just
think
it'll
deflect
any
criticism
but
realistically
the
rest
of
us
will
all
still
think
you're
ignorant
how
do
you
tell
a
guy
you
can't
hook
up
because
you're
on
your
period
i
always
feel
so
awkward
am
i
the
only
person
that
feels
like
they
haven't
learned
anything
at
all
in
any
class
every
class
is
a
struggle
to
cram
as
much
as
possible
for
a
test
then
your
hard
drive
gets
dumped
as
soon
as
you
barely
pass
the
test
teachers
here
blow
ass
arrogant
researchers
that
assume
you
know
everything
every
lecture
they
treat
it
like
a
review
instead
of
teaching
my
biggest
dissatisfaction
with
brown
so
far
has
been
the
internet
speed
and
connectivity
why
can't
brown
get
better
internet
quality
what
are
the
fedoras
and
how
are
they
a
counterargument
reason
to
disregard
opinions
1497
baseball
players
and
soccer
players
are
seriously
the
hottest
athletes
are
any
of
you
guys
single
does
anybody
else
realize
more
than
half
of
vine
is
recordings
of
bunch
of
black
people
9448
look
at
me
and
what
do
you
see
intelligence
beyond
compare
but
inside
i
am
stirring
something
strange
is
occuring
it's
a
secret
i
need
to
share
hip
hop
is
my
passion
i
love
to
pop
and
lock
and
jam
and
break
it's
just
dancing
sometimes
i
think
it's
cooler
than
homework
i'm
tired
of
everyone
liking
me
until
they
find
out
i'm
atheist
i
don't
bash
on
anyone's
beliefs
i
just
don't
agree
with
them
and
that
makes
me
a
bad
person
i
live
my
life
the
best
i
can
because
i
think
that's
the
right
thing
to
do
i
don't
need
god
to
tell
me
what's
right
and
wrong
and
if
i
go
to
hell
well
then
that's
my
problem
not
anyone
else's
so
stop
judging
people
you
don't
have
to
love
god
in
order
to
be
a
good
person
girls
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
obviously
there
are
plenty
of
confessions
that
say
i
saw
this
one
girl
insert
story
details
here
and
i
didn't
get
her
name
but
if
someone
can
help
me
find
her
so
my
question
is
how
do
you
personally
feel
about
this
there
are
times
us
guys
never
get
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
you
do
you
feel
flattered
do
you
feel
weird
should
us
guys
stop
doing
this
also
on
a
side
note
how
about
us
guys
would
any
of
us
ever
feel
flattered
if
a
girl
tried
to
get
in
contact
with
us
on
her
or
would
it
just
as
weird
honestly
i
would
find
it
awesome
if
a
girl
did
this
for
me
but
that's
just
my
opinion
how
does
a
guy
go
about
asking
a
girl
out
in
the
library
it's
too
quiet
to
have
a
conversation
without
everyone
in
the
room
hating
your
guts
for
talking
and
i
feel
like
waiting
for
a
girl
to
leave
and
then
bringing
up
a
random
conversation
is
too
creepy
someone
comment
and
explain
to
me
how
jesus
wasn't
just
a
really
cool
guy
that
built
shit
out
of
wood
and
threw
a
few
partys
14946
i
am
madly
in
love
with
my
best
friend
who
goes
to
another
school
i
broke
up
with
my
boyfriend
of
years
a
few
months
ago
and
thought
that
maybe
my
friend
and
i
could
give
us
a
chance
but
something
he
said
to
me
today
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
doesn't
feel
the
same
way
about
me
idk
what
to
do
should
i
tell
him
i
love
him
and
risk
making
things
awkward
and
if
so
how
the
f
ck
do
i
say
it
7041
i
fucking
hate
the
chimes
concerts
they
don't
bring
joy
only
pain
the
one
at
1
15
pm
is
okay
but
the
other
times
they
play
make
no
fucking
sense
they
are
awful
i
laugh
when
they
mess
up
because
it
shows
how
big
a
joke
they
are
and
the
8am
one
fuck
you
hi
wildcats
if
anyone
recognizes
this
asshole
below
can
you
please
please
please
contact
me
this
is
a
still
from
video
footage
taken
at
campco
around
1
15
am
on
fri
2
22
i
went
down
to
the
durham
police
station
and
after
careful
observation
we
deduced
that
this
guy
stole
my
purse
used
my
debit
card
to
buy
30
worth
of
cigars
gatorade
etc
sorry
that
this
photo
is
a
little
small
i
took
a
screenshot
of
my
email
and
can't
figure
out
to
to
make
it
bigger
on
here
message
me
if
you
think
you
recognize
him
and
i'll
be
forever
grateful
thanks
i
see
so
many
beautiful
women
on
this
campus
they
all
seem
nice
and
smile
but
every
time
i
try
to
walk
up
to
one
and
try
to
start
a
conversation
they
just
give
me
weird
looks
and
short
answers
can
someone
explain
what
i'm
doing
wrong
i
don't
know
what
goes
on
in
girls
heads
but
honestly
what
went
on
in
y'all's
heads
between
highschool
and
college
that
said
you
should
go
from
dressing
nice
to
wearing
nike
shorts
and
oversized
t
shirts
who's
the
cute
boy
with
the
blonde
streak
in
his
hair
he
wears
this
hat
that
says
drugs
on
it
why
do
so
many
people
go
to
other
countries
to
adopt
kids
when
there
are
so
many
kids
here
in
the
u.s
who
need
homes
11093
i
really
want
to
ta
two
classes
of
mine
but
they
are
from
the
same
department
can
i
still
do
this
or
how
does
that
work
i
don't
know
who
to
ask
about
this
261
why
use
study
rooms
to
study
when
you
can
use
them
for
wall
twerking
freshman
year
i
used
to
hook
up
with
a
guy
in
stoke
208
one
night
he
forgot
to
lock
the
door
and
some
guy
comes
in
at
4
am
climbs
under
the
blankets
at
the
end
of
the
bed
wiggles
his
way
between
us
half
asleep
i
think
oh
this
must
be
one
of
our
drunk
friends
needed
a
place
to
sleep
and
drifted
back
to
sleep
for
a
second
realizing
how
absurd
this
is
with
his
feet
in
my
face
a
second
later
i
jumped
up
half
naked
woke
my
hook
up
buddy
and
pointed
to
our
new
snuggle
buddy
um
do
u
know
who
this
is
he
jumps
up
freaked
out
i
grab
the
sheets
n
run
into
the
hallway
as
he
yells
at
the
guy
bro
what
are
you
doing
dude
this
is
not
your
room
mr
random
then
stumbles
out
of
the
room
in
nothing
but
leprechaun
shamrock
boxers
quickly
looks
around
before
falling
against
the
wall
sprinted
down
the
hall
never
to
be
seen
again
his
identity
remains
a
mystery
to
this
day
i
know
this
is
kind
of
bitchy
but
honestly
i
haven't
slept
in
days
and
it
needs
to
be
said
this
campus
runs
on
a
very
consistent
schedule
especially
during
fourth
week
on
the
morning
of
the
wednesday
of
fourth
week
the
majority
of
this
campus
is
taking
exams
all
over
the
campus
because
we
are
thankfully
allowed
that
freedom
so
why
is
it
that
every
fourth
wednesday
there
are
people
all
over
campus
doing
loud
maintenance
on
the
campus
i
know
that
it
is
the
job
of
these
people
and
that
they
are
just
trying
to
help
make
the
campus
a
better
place
i
know
but
i
go
here
to
learn
and
to
plan
for
my
future
and
i
find
it
disrespectful
that
i
cannot
take
my
exams
in
my
usual
study
spaces
because
the
lawn
mower
runs
past
the
window
for
10
minutes
i
just
want
to
be
able
to
do
well
and
this
happens
no
matter
where
i
move
and
it
happens
every
block
i
just
want
to
finish
this
exam
and
sleep
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
type
this
the
lawn
mower
has
still
not
gone
away

sorry
finals
n
stuff
you
know
i'm
back
tho
so
i
got
a
bad
grade
on
this
test
and
i
thought
to
myself
maybe
i
should
start
jerking
off
with
my
left
hand
to
change
my
luck
you
know
i
did
although
it
didn't
end
up
working
out
because
i
got
an
even
worst
grade
on
my
next
exam
maybe
i
need
to
buy
a
pocket
pussy
or
something
does
anyone
have
any
ideas
studying
more
is
out
of
the
question
653
i
really
wish
freshmen
would
realize
that
sorry
can
you
repeat
that
is
a
question
you
should
never
ask
in
any
class
ever
i
think
it's
selfish
to
think
that
your
inability
to
comprehend
something
merits
taking
class
time
away
from
other
students
who
don't
have
cognitive
impairments
i
like
to
smell
my
farts
underneath
my
blanket
would
guys
find
that
unattractive
are
there
any
sororities
that
do

11839
am
i
the
only
one
who
has
noticed
a
trend
of
gay
white
men
who
are
straight
for
black
women
i've
met
several
white
men
at
cornell
who
i
thought
were
gay
but
later
found
out
that
most
if
not
all
of
their
past
relationships
were
with
black
women
16476
i
am
the
person
who
set
off
the
fire
alarm
in
cascadilla
on
the
first
or
second
night
of
classes
sorry
everyone
had
to
go
outside
at
least
it
wasn't
cold
though
right
where
are
all
the
moderately
attractive
gay
guys
with
livable
attitudes
and
realistic
standards
i
don't
think
i'm
asking
for
a
lot
here
and
yet
you're
a
fucking
unicorn
does
a
field
goal
get
half
a
kiss

when
someone
is
attracted
to
you
had
sex
with
you
and
then
decides
they
don't
want
to
ruin
a
friendship
with
you
how
do
you
get
them
we're
never
gonna
really
be
friends
now
after
this
as
much
as
you
hope
we
can
how
many
of
you
guys
think
we'll
actually
have
a
good
football
team
this
coming
season
i'll
be
surprised
if
we
actually
go

2268
i'm
excited
to
go
back
to
nyu
to
be
in
the
city
and
experience
everything
that
i
loved
so
much
about
the
school
this
past
year
but
the
real
reason
a
reason
i'm
way
to
shy
to
ever
admit
because
i'm
afraid
of
being
judged
by
the
people
who
wouldn't
understand
is
that
i'm
excited
to
go
back
because
i
miss
my
sorority
sisters
more
than
anything
in
this
world
my
family
and
friends
from
home
don't
understand
how
i
of
all
people
became
a
sorority
girl
especially
at
such
a
non
greek
life
school
but
i
most
certainly
did
and
you
know
what
i'm
fucking
proud
ugh
i
just
can't
wait
to
wear
my
key
with
my
sisters
again
i
am
a
proud
smoker
not
a
social
smoker
a
smoking
smoker
a
buys
his
own
packs
smoker
i
know
there
are
health
problems
associated
with
smoking
and
i
know
it's
a
turnoff
for
many
somehow
stranger
you
weren't
the
first
person
to
inform
me
of
these
facts
please
don't
look
down
upon
me
as
a
degenerate
of
some
kind
please
try
and
hold
back
that
look
of
disdain
i'll
make
an
effort
to
smoke
downwind
of
you
and
not
comment
on
your
life
choices
at
least
until
i
get
to
know
you
one
day
when
you're
piss
drunk
outside
of
the
cove
and
your
friends
have
all
disappeared
or
you're
dog
tired
outside
taking
a
break
from
the
florescent
lit
hell
that
is
olin
i
will
be
there
for
you
sure
you
can
bum
a
smoke
do
you
need
a
light
i
have
had
sex
with
over
100
women
at
texas
a
m
is
this
wrong
54
i
basically
offered
sex
to
my
ra
which
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
so
did
i
until
he
gave
me
an
std
are
all
hot
guys
dirty
i
am
way
more
excited
about
frozen
than
i
am
about
beyonce's
new
album
anyone
with
me
sorrynotsorry
so
i
really
want
to
beat
the
shit
out
of
my
sister's
ex
boyfriend
for
good
reason
i
don't
really
expect
to
actually
do
it
but
i've
been
thinking
about
it
constantly
which
has
resulted
in
a
lot
of
pent
up
aggression
that
has
led
me
to
believe
i
need
some
sort
of
outlet
does
cc
have
punching
bags
or
anything
i
secretly
laugh
to
myself
when
guys
stand
up
on
the
bus
for
girls
to
sit
down
these
are
some
grown
women
they
can
stand
for
10
minutes
also
do
you
think
the
girl
is
ever
going
to
remember
you
or
be
like
wow
i
want
to
totally
bang
this
guy
i
really
don't
want
to
fuck
up
our
friendship
but
i
don't
know
how
to
turn
off
this
crush
can
we
at
least
cuddle
1217
i
know
heavy
secrets
get
the
most
attention
on
here
but
i
just
want
to
wish
everyone
an
awesome
monday
i
feel
like
being
positive
is
almost
a
taboo
to
some
people
at
nyu
i
don't
know
if
it's
the
nyc
environment
our
school
or
just
the
age
we
live
in
but
it
seems
people
our
age
are
becoming
more
and
more
fearful
of
optimism
kindness
and
human
to
human
realness
i'm
not
saying
life
doesn't
suck
sometimes
i'm
just
saying
i
haven't
got
anything
to
complain
about
right
now
and
on
some
real
talk
i
love
you
all
what
have
i
got
to
lose
had
my
first
desk
pop
today
that's
a
thing
right

if
im
graduating
a
semester
late
dec
2014

i
still
get
to
participate
in
senior
activities
and
walk
with
my
class
for
commencement

spent
so
much
time

i
think
i
deserve
the
big
spring
summer
graduation
brianna
sisson
you
are
incredibly
beautiful
and
ridiculously
sweet
where
your
boyfriend
at
why
would
you
sit
in
the
place
i've
been
sitting
every
day
at
the
end
of
second
week
i
use
my
dead
grandma's
handicap
sticker
to
park
on
campus
because
it's
closer
and
i'm
always
running
late
does
that
make
me
a
bad
person
17788
i
feel
like
my
positive
energy
catches
people
off
guard
so
much
that
i
freak
them
out
why
is
joyousness
that
rare
that
any
encounters
with
it
scare
people
so
much

when
i
broke
up
with
my
ex
this
guy
was
beside
me
helping
me
get
through
the
agonizing
moment
the
next
thing
i
realize
is
that
i
am
falling
for
him
he
is
5
years
older
than
i
the
main
reason
i'm
still
holding
back
is
that
i'm
not
certain
if
he
feels
the
same
even
though
we
talk
to
each
other
every
day
what
should
i
do
16331
i
really
like
this
guy
i
just
met
but
i
just
broke
up
with
my
boyfriend
last
month
is
he

rebound

are
guys
here

scared
of
actually
communicating

by

in

who
am
i
to

the

as
a
bisexual
guy
who's
never
had
a
relationship
with
another
male
i'd
really
like
to
try
that
out
in
cornell
sometime
this
year
the
problem
is
that
it
seems
most
bi
gay
guys
are
looking
only
for
one
night
hookups
and
nothing
else
is
there
anyone
looking
for
something
more
i
currently
going
through
a
bad
breakup
and
i
have
been
suicidal
for
about
a
year
now
i
am
thinking
about
taking
the
next
semester
off
to
clear
my
mind
and
to
find
myself
again
anyone
who
had
gone
through
the
process
of
withdrawing
for
one
semester
do
you
mind
sharing
with
me
your
process
and
if
it's
worth
it
i
am
very
far
ahead
in
terms
of
my
academics
so
my
studies
are
not
affected
at
all
but
i
know
i
can't
keep
it
up
anymore
any
advice
is
appreciated

today
my
friend
received
a
heavy
package
from
amazon
he
wouldn't
tell
me
what
it
was
until
were
were
somewhere
safe
we
went
to
his
room
closed
the
blinds
and
locked
the
door
he
opened
the
package
and
turns
out
he
ordered
10
lbs
of
gummy
worms
who
orders
that
much
candy
from
amazon
the
only
reason
why
i'm
posting
this
anonymously
is
because
he
doesn't
want
his
roommate
to
find
out
i
have
a
question
i
am
completely
in
support
of
gay
rights
and
i
read
on
a
comment
about
actual
scientific
studies
on
the
genetic
transfer
of
homosexuality
can
anyone
direct
me
to
those
studies
they
sound
super
interesting
211
i
told
my
dad
i
was
going
to
drop
out
of
school
and
post
on
anonymous
confession
board
professionally
and
he
was
outraged
like
seriously
dad's
don't
even
do
anything
what's
his
big
deal
i
like
kebab
and
chick
fil
a
when
i
look
at
those
foods
on
my
plate
my
heart
skips
a
beat
i
think
i
may
have
a
problem
or
maybe
i
am
in
love
what
is
love
sex
on
the
3rd
date
nah
more
like
date
on
the
third
fuck
now
that
i've
graduated
does
this
mean
that
i
have
to
frame
all
of
my
wall
posters
since
i'm
an
adult
and
all
reading
a
story
on
hacker
news
about
a
woman
who
supposedly
started
her
own
tech
company
with
no
technical
knowledge
and
completely
on
her
own
link
https
news.ycombinator.com
item
id
7458076
the
problem
is
that
well
she
didn't
there's
some
evidence
she
cut
out
her
technical
co
founder
a
man
of
course
and
her
website
wasn't
willed
into
existence
by
the
power
of
her
mind
so
the
story
of
the
single
female
going
on
her
own
is
complete
bs
this
female
martyr
syndrome
that
seems
to
be
plaguing
the
world
is
really
starting
to
piss
me
off
it'd
be
fine
if
she
admitted
she
had
help
like
any
guy
in
her
position
would
do
but
oh
no
it's
all
her
grrrrl
power
now
she
goes
ahead
and
moves
to
san
francisco
hires
oh
look
an
exclusively
male
team
argh
sexism
who
she
has
make
her
new
site
now
she
gets
to
strut
around
talking
about
female
empowerment

i
think
yes
so
i
just
want
to
know
what
level
of
stupid
you
must
be
on
to
do
the
following
i'm
in
a
facebook
group
for
one
of
my
anthropology
courses
where
we
ask
questions
help
each
other
study
vent
about
stupid
test
etc
ect
you
get
the
picture
anyways
on
said
facebook
page
the
test
dates
are
listed
the
test
we
took
on
3
26
yesterday
and
the
person
who
made
the
facebook
group
mistakenly
wrote
3
36
any
logical
person
would
check
the
syllabus
if
they
were
confused
right
any
smart
person
would
see
all
the
posts
about
two
weeks
leading
up
to
the
tests
discussion
the
reviews
asking
questions
even
asking
the
test
date
twice
right
well
this
one
chick
evidently
thinks
the
test
is
on
3
36
and
misses
the
exam
at
this
point
if
i
did
this
i
would
just
kick
myself
for
being
so
dumb
because
who
doesn't
know
there
isn't
36
days
in
any
month
of
the
year
but
no
she
messages
the
girl
who
made
the
facebook
group
furious
and
accusing
her
of
ruining
her
academic
career
and
causing
her
to
get
a
0
on
the
exam
please
please
please
tell
me
she's
joking
please
tell
me
people
aren't
this
stupid
i
mean
okay
you
missed
the
exam
for
your
idiocy
but
to
blame
it
on
someone
else
you
just
done
embarrassed
yourself
and
made
yourself
look
even
dumber
than
you
already
are
advice
invest
in
a
planner
write
down
important
dates
well
in
advance
and
learn
that
no
month
has
more
than
31
days
oh

another
thing

little
alert

how
did
i
almost
set
a
building
on
fire
one
morning
i
was
trying
to
make
some
eggs
before
class
but
decided
to
take
a
5
minute
shower
while
the
pan
heated
up
instead
of
just
getting
hot
the
oil
started
fuming
so
much
that
the
smoke
made
the
fire
alarm
react
with
an
initial
signal
by
the
time
i
got
back
i
threw
out
the
oil
and
opened
the
window
to
try
to
vent
the
kitchen
all
this
was
to
no
avail
a
minute
later
the
real
alarm
kicked
in
and
so
i
ran
back
to
my
room
to
change
as
everyone
left
the
building
during
that
cold
as
hell
november
morning
i
heard
a
ton
of
grumbling
and
complaining
as
the
fire
guys
got
there
i
just
left
and
went
to
class
i
was
so

this
stupid
again
btw
it
was
about

what
do
you
mean
grad
students
aren't
invited
to
hook
up
culture
i
just
hooked
up
yesterday
we
are
definitely
invited
to
the
people
who
post
comments
defending
racial
ignorance
and
insinuate
the
unfairness
of
some
sort
of
minority
privilege
you
are
aware
that
the
whole
school
can
see
you
right
looking
for
a
hook
up

i
get
a
hot
chocolate
at
goldie's
before
class
in
the
morning
for
the
sole
purpose
of
maybe
seeing
you
at
one
of
the
tables
does
that
make
me
a
stalker
either
way
it's
eating
up
my
brbs
why
the
fuck
do
we
keep
on
talking
about
the
golf
kart
guys
as
it
is
none
of
our
business
well
if
you
don't
want
the
campus
to
talk
about
you
or
be
noticed
don't
get
a
fucking
golf
kart
to
show
off
as
you
know
everyone
will
notice
you
douching
it
around
so
don't
even
pretend
like
we're
bad
for
talking
about
this
when
these
guys
brought
the
attention
onto
themselves
simply
due
to
the
nature
of
the
vehicle
they
drove
around
you
wanna
be
unnoticed
when
you
do
your
stupid
drunk
stuff
plenty
kids
have
done
stupid
stuff
on
their
boards
no
one
ever
talks
about
it
once
again
don't
wanna
be
talked
about
don't
drive
a
golf
kart
guuuuuump
what
is
your
sole
purpose
in
this
army
to
do
whatever
you
tell
me
to
drill
sergeant
so
for
the
second
time
this
season
i
got
free
tickets
to
the
football
game
you
heard
me
right
second
time
shout
out
to
the
three
girls
who
let
me
have
it
for
free
and
thanks
to
their
fourth
friend
who
decided
to
ditch
the
game
which
is
why
i
got
it
plus
i
thought
the
brunette
in
white
silverish
sweater
jacket
was
very
cute
and
her
laughter
was
loud
and
equally
adorable
i
think
your
name
is
morgan
i
feel
like
an
idiot
for
not
introducing
myself
actually
i
was
very
into
the
game
anyway
if
you
see
this
please
comment
below
and
allow
me
to
buy
you
a
drink
at
northgate
next
weekend
just
to
return
the
favor
also
too
bad
we
didn't
have
a
lead
of
75
i
could
have
been
at
the
receiving
end
of
that
kiss
laugh
out
loud
by
the
way
it
seemed
like
carson's
injury
was
really
severe
was
it
a
head
injury
or
neck
injury
i
am
not
very
religious
but
i
pray
that
he
gets
fit
soon
congratulations
to
every
aggie
on
our
victory
sincerely

i
feel
more
i
spend
more
time
studying
alone
than
many
others
here
but
not
more
than
everyone
here
and
i'm
not
just
always
in
seclusion
yet
everyone
else
seems
to
have
friends
to
be
with
when
they're
not
studying
or
even
while
they
are
i
don't
think
many
people
who
know
me
simply
dislike
me
and
have
a
lot
of
acquaintances
and
have
great
conversations
with
people
when
i
do
go
to
parties
but
they
never
really
turn
into
good
friendships
i
try
but
i
don't
really
know
how
i
text
others
to
do
things
but
no
one
ever
reaches
out
to
me
like
i
imagine
would
happen
in
a
real
friendship
why
can't
i
make
friends
what
is
wrong
with
me
i
am
a
caucasian
female
who
came
to
nu
from
a
high
school
that
was
over
50
asian
where
i
only
ever
dated
asian
guys
i
didn't
even
look
twice
at
white
guys
until
i
came
to
college
and
even
then
only
because
i
don't
have
any
asian
friends
at
all
right
now
which
is
a
weird
position
for
me
so
where
are
all
the
asian
guys
who
like
white
girls
y'all
have
to
exist
right
and
on
kind
of
a
larger
scale
why
do
a
lot
of
people
here
only
hang
out
with
people
of
the
same
race
what's
your
secret

i'm
so
tired
of
being
emotionally
abused
by
both
of
my
parents
i
honestly
don't
know
what
to
do
about
it
anymore
i
tell
my
friends
what
i'm
going
through
but
they
can't
really
understand
so
i
feel
very
alone
with
this
part
of
my
life
is
anyone
else
dealing
with
this
problem
what
should
i
do
i
play
guitar
outside
hobby
hall
once
or
twice
a
week
at
night
i
have
a
red
guitar
i
love
to
play
been
doing
it
for
a
long
time
people
come
up
and
ask
why
i
do
it
here's
why
i
love
to
play
but
the
opportunity
doesn't
always
come
up
to
play
for
other
because
it's
not
practical
but
outside
i
can
enjoy
the
outdoors
the
guitar
and
everyone
passing
by
whether
they
stop
and
listen
or
not
i
don't
do
it
to
get
girls
i
just
love
to
play
although
if
girls
like
it
its
a
plus
jus
sayin
stop
by
sometime

go

it
really
bothers
me
that
nobody
looks
each
other
in
the
eye
when
they
walk
around
campus
i
took
a
little
bit
too
much
lsd
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
started
wandering
around
campus
by
myself
it
made
me
really
sad
that
nobody
was
willing
to
look
me
in
the
eye
and
smile
isn't
anybody
happy
to
be
going
here
holy
shit
why
the
fuck
is
circumcision
such
a
big
deal
on
this
page
you
liberal
twatfucks
and
everybody
freaking
the
fuck
out
about
cutting
a
little
foreskin
need
to
snort
some
adderal
and
get
back
to
studying
non
stem
coursework
my
dad
was
circumcised
i
was
circumcised
more
than
half
my
friends
are
circumcised
and
in
no
way
have
i
or
any
of
us
suffered
from
being
cut
i
still
have
tons
of
great
sex
that
feels
amazing
and
i'm
relieved
at
the
fact
that
i
don't
have
to
retract
my
dick
out
of
all
that
wrinkly
ass
skin
like
some
damn
dog
when
i
have
to
take
a
piss
or
wash
it
if
you
want
to
keep
on
fucking
each
other
and
killing
fetuses
in
this
liberal
circle
jerk
that
y'all
have
going
on
in
the
comment
section
then
by
all
means
keep
doing
so
but
if
i'm
gonna
let
y'all
fuck
and
get
aids
because
it's
your
damn
lives
then
by
god
let
me
cut
some
fucking
fore
skin
shit
nigga
does
anyone
else
thinks
it's
ironic
that
unh
tirelessly
puts
up
signs
on
how
to
be
eat
healthy
and
healthy
living
but
at
the
same
time
provides
about
10
treadmills
for
the
entire
undergraduate
population
i'm
a
guy
and
i
go
to
the
rec
pretty
often
to
get
myself
in
better
shape
much
better
than
i
used
to
be
the
thing
is
every
now
and
then
i
see
a
different
truly
stunning
drop
dead
gorgeous
girl
i
feel
like
introducing
myself
but
i
know
girls
generally
don't
want
to
be
talked
to
or
bothered
at
the
gym
i'm
not
terribly
shy
of
a
person
but
i
want
to
hear
from
some
of
the
girls
who
follow
this
page
for
your
personal
opinion
should
i
even
bother
trying
to
make
an
honest
introduction
of
myself
or
would
you
really
rather
not
hear
what
you
already
know
which
is
that
your
determination
and
hard
work
that
it
takes
to
keep
yourselves
in
shape
is
really
attractive
i
had
an
abortion
and
though
i
know
most
people
are
against
it
i
know
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
for
me
selfish
yes
the
guy
left
me
when
he
found
out
i
still
had
a
lot
of
school
to
finish
up
i
am
not
heartless
i
live
with
my
choice
everyday
but
i
do
not
regret
it
to
the
girl
who
said
she's
possibly
pregnant
and
thinking
about
an
abortion
lay
out
a
list
of
pros
and
cons
and
truly
think
about
your
decision
it's
not
an
easy
process
it's
painful
psychically
but
even
more
mentally
there
are
more
people
than
you
think
who
have
gotten
an
abortion
than
you
think
to
those
who
judge
me
you
may
call
me
a
slut
whore
bad
person
you
don't
know
it
until
you
have
been
through

whats
the

what
has

got

do
with
the

if
an
aggie
does
not
lie
cheat

or
tolerates
those
who
do
then
why
do
we
have
a
political
science
department
yo
to
whoever
bled
on
the
floor
of
that
one
girls
bathroom
in
mcbride
last
night
would
you
mind
cleaning
it
up
i
totally
feel
how
it
must've
been
a
traumatic
and
possibly
drunk
moment
for
you
but
i
almost
stepped
on
your
bloody
nose
goop
this
morning
and
it
should
probably
be
taken
care
of
i
would
do
it
myself
but
yknow
it's
blood
why
don't
some
guys
cut
their
nails
it's
disgusting
seeing
a
guy
with
long
nails
it
takes
two
minutes
to
cut
them
how
can
you
tell
a
guy
went
to
catholic
school
he
has
no
condoms
and
puts
his
shorts
on
under
his
towel
after
he
gets
out
of
the
shower
despite
the
fact
that
you've
had
sex
9
times
it's
okay
honey
i've
seen
it
before
it's
great
when
people
succeed
even
when
people
i
don't
like
achieve
something
they
very
much
wanted
it
makes
me
smile
however
when
every
single
status
is
about
yourself
and
your
accomplishments
or
you
talk
about
just
yourself
it
makes
me
cringe
what
is
worse
is
when
these
people
start
quoting
themselves
and
what
they
think
will
be
these
memorable
quotes
when
they
are
big
and
famous
do
these
people
really
think
people
like
einstein
or
winston
churchill
or
eleanor
roosevelt
put
their
names
after
everything
they
said
like
they
were
reading
from
a
book
rant
over
why
is
it
so
hard
for
people
to
make
the
connection
between
internet
and
wi
fi
this
is
why
companies
take
advantage
of
people
and
say
for
only
40
a
month
you
can
have
internet
but
for
a
limited
time
offer
if
you
buy
now
you
will
also
get
wi
fi
connection
for
10
more
other
companies
charge
25
lol
just
go
buy
a
router
and
set
it
up
yourselves
people
wake
up
there
should
be
a
class
required
to
be
taken
every

on

that's
what
it'll
be
called

my
confession
is
that
i
dislike
people
especially
girls
who
complain
about
having
to
put
up
with
jerks
and
wonder
why
they
can't
meet
a
nice
guy
you
girls
need
some
common
sense
there
are
many
nice
guys
out
there
the
reason
why
you
are
not
with
one
is
because
you
are
attracted
to
the
guy
thats
going
to
end
up
hurting
you
one
night
stands
and
hook
ups
are
not
going
to
help
either
you
really
think
that
frat
bro
you
meet
at
pixel
cares
about
you
your
actions
speak
louder
than
words
you
have
no
one
to
blame
but
yourselves
stop
pretending
like
you
dont
know
this
if
you
want
real
change
i
suggest
you
grow
up
and
stop
playing
games
apologies
for
over
generalizing
and
most
frat
bros
i
know
are
cool
16021
i
get
a
small
headache
every
time
i
open

rushika
athia

do
you

barbie
dolls
waiting
in
line
for
a
plate
of
meat
a
barbie
queue
i
confess
i
am
a
popular
syndicated
radio
jock
from
texas
the
trick
is
guess
who
am
i
there
is
this
really
cute
girl
who
always
its
in
the
same
spot
in
the
flag
room
i
took
the
initiative
to
be
bold
and
introduce
myself
to
her
we
chatted
for
a
little
bit
and
then
i
left
to
go
to
my
next
class
i
would
really
like
to
ask
her
out
to
lunch
and
see
where
it
goes
from
there
i'm
afraid
i'm
going
to
get
cold
feet
and
i'll
mess
it
up
some
how
or
that
she'll
already
be
in
a
relationship
or
talking
to
someone
ladies
of
texas
a
m
confessions
if
you
were
a
single
fairly
attractive
and
seemingly
sweet
girl
what
approach
would
be
the
most
receptive
to
you
in
terms
of
trying
to
get
you
to
come
have
lunch
with
me
with
the
prospect
of
going
on
a
date
thereafter
all
this
assuming
you
hardly
knew
me
i'm
just
that
guy
you
met
in
the
flag
room
and
had
small
talk
with
i
don't
want
to
make
it
seem
that
i'm
desperate
or
thirsty
i
just
like
to
take
considerate
and
calculated
approaches
when
it
comes
to
how
i
approach
women
will
i
ever
meet
anyone
who
loves
10
years
as
much
as
i
do
since
i
moved
here
everyone
i've
ever
told
about
them
doesn't
have
a
clue
who
they
are
does
school
make
anyone
else
feel
dead
on
the
inside
in
the
annex
white

notice
there

this
guy
i've
been
talking

a

so
we
can
hook
up
he
is
super
hot

to
his
advantage

only
texts
me
when
he
wants
to

4514
goddamnit
why
couldn't
i
have
met
you
first
are
there
any
girls
in
this
town
who
actually
appreciate
what
a
hung
guy
brings
to
the
table
17324
as
a
latin
american
i
find
it
funny
that
latinos
are
more
sensible
to
cultural
stereotypes
and
racism
than
ourselves
the
so
much
racist
stereotypes
that
you
are
talking
about
are
common
topics
in
our
countries
and
we
are
used
to
them
because
even
if
you
dont
want
to
admit
show
part
of
our
culture
just
look
at
their
shows
in
univision
or
local
channels
do
you

few
comedic
shows
that
use
the
racist
stereotypes
that
you
feel
offended
by
as
a
source
of
humor
and
do
you
see
in
this
case
mexicans
offended
about
it
they
know
some
of
the
topics
touched
are
true
and
before
you
bring
the
white
oppression
influencing
mexican
culture
it
is
already
embedded
in
their
culture
seriously
we
latin
americans
have
more
important
things
to
worry
about
that
people
using
stereotypes
we
left
our
countries
for
a
reason
and
we
know
how
harsh
is
living
in
those
countries
were
racial
slurs
are
nothing
compared
to
not
knowing
if
you
will
be
able
to
eat
or
even
live
the
following
day
this
is
why
a
latin
american
latino
are
jay
and
jacob
from
slocum
a
thing
so
confusing
people
get
all
butthurt
about
women
not
being
allowed
to
vote
until
the
1900s
but
think
about
it
it
makes
sense
ever
met
a
woman
who
wasn't
indecisive
if
we
let
them
vote
it'll
take
up
the
entire
damn
voting
time
because
they'll
be
hogging
the
booth
until
they
finally
make
a
decision
how
come
every
time
i
think
about
snapchatting
the
admins
i
happen
to
be
naked
like
just
no
sorry
guys
no
boobies
coming
your
way
and
nothing
interesting
either
for
that
matter
how
sad
anxious
self
hating
do
you
have
to
feel
to
schedule
a
counseling
appointment
at
boettcher
and
benefit
from
it
i
don't
want
to
be
taking
time
away
from
someone
else
who
may
need
it
more
than
i
do
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
something
unpleasant
has
been
happening
to
my
mental
state
over
the
past
few
months
and
i'd
really
like
it
to
stop
before
it
gets
any
worse
as
a
metalhead
i
usually
flash
the
devil
horns
backwards
so
as
not
to
be
confused
for
a
t
sip
how
do
my
fellow
aggie
headbangers
do
it
i
once
heard
from
someone
from
the
core
that
there
was
a
buried
here
on
campus
and
only
the
core
know
about
it
and
where
it
was
the
person
who
told
me
wouldn't
tell
me
anything
else
do
any
of
ya'll
know
i'm
just
really
curious
i
have
a
5
inch
cock
which
makes
me
scared
to
do
anything
with
a
girl
what
can
i
do
why
is
it
that
when
i
was
an
underclassman
i
always
had
a
bunch
of
guys
who
liked
me
but
now
that
i'm
a
senior
it
feels
like
no
guy
is
ever
interested
anymore
is
it
because
ive
slept
with
them
all
already
i'm
sure
as
a
guy
the
man
of
many
women
who
slept
with
100
girls
and
was
interviewed
in
the
sun
doesn't
have
this
problem
41
i
think
eminem
is
totally
inspiring
except
that
i
don't
get
the
whole
slim
shady
thing
is
that
a
spooky
ghost
that
haunts
him
or
something
i
very
rarely
got
spanked
maybe
twice
as
a
kid
because
i
was
so
eager
to
please
that
all
it
took
was
a
stern
look
and
i
was
reduced
to
tears
and
apologies
my
brother
on
the
other
hand
got
tons
of
spankings
because
he
was
very
strong
willed
and
always
getting
in
trouble
we
both
turned
out
to
be
successful
respectful
intelligent
members
of
society
the
point
is
there's
no
one
size
fits
all
way
of
raising
kids
the
important
thing
is
to
understand
your
kids
well
enough
to
know
what
kind
of
discipline
will
work
on
them
and
to
set
boundaries
no
matter
how
you
enforce
them
boundaries
are
what
makes
the
difference
between
a
hoodlum
and
an
honor
student

the

does
anyone

if
it's

that

is
a
flying
spaghetti
monster
who

turn
to
if
and
when
these
things
are
gone
my
confession
i've
found
the
one
thing
in
life
that
is
constant
true
and
never
fails
me
his
her
name
is
the
flying
spaghetti
monster
give
him
her
a
chance

there
was
a
short
white
girl
i
talked
to
at
the
frat
sorority
tailgate
party
basically
asking
if
i
culd
play
the
game
she
was
playing
she
asked
if
i
was
in
a
frat
and
i
said
no
then
she
asked
if
i
was
a
freshman
and
i
said
no
then
she
looked
away
and
walked
right
past
me
this
is
not
for
every
sorority
girl
but
just
for
her
what
did
u
have
for
breakfast
that
morning
carnation
instant
bitch
so
if
i'm
a
transfer
student
and
don't
know
anyone
and
want
to
just
go
to
a
random
party
where
should
i
go
i
want
to
enjoy
college
life
but
don't
want
to
be
that
guy
and
get
kicked
out
like
an
a
hole
because
someone
realizes
no
one
knows
me
help
me
socialize
unh
i
can't
awkward
freshman
connect
anymore
everyone
already
has
a
tight
group
of
friends
my
ex
and
i
meet
freshman
year
we
lived
in
the
same
building
things
went
really
good
for
about
a
year
and
half
i
then
find
out
like
2
weeks
before
our
2
year
that
she
had
cheated
on
me
she
is
a
horrible
person
i
had
to
know
it
was
coming
tho
she
has
cheated
on
every
single
one
of
her
boyfriends
why
was
i
to
be
any
different
she
is
now
in
vet
school
here
at
a
m
and
is
talking
to
another
guy
and
i
really
just
want
to
tell
him
that
she
will
eventually
cheat
on
him
and
that
she
is
a
heartless
bitch
what
should
i
do
i
changed
my
major
senior
year
no
regrets
i
want
to
graduate
with
something
that
i
love
and
that
will
actually
make
me
money
went
from
colsa
to
ceps
i
once
felt
embarrassed
about
being
a
22
year
old
amongst
freshman
but
then
i
noticed
30
year
old
people
in
my
classes
can
we
just
take
a
moment
to
appreciate
these
students
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage
for
these
people
to
go
back
to
school
with
what
i'm
sure
they
consider
to
be
kids

to
christina
in
new
south
that
i
met
at
club
lau
why
have
i
not
seen
you
since
then
it
annoys
me
when
non
rice
affiliated
people
bring
their
little
kids
on
campus
like
why
are
you
trying
to
ruin
my
sterile
academic
heaven
with
your
snot
nosed
fecundity
urgh
are
we
allowed

i've
been
seeing
a
lot
of
hate
against
white
people
this
year
on
cc
confessions
and
i
was
wondering
where
it
all
came
from
honestly
we
have
allowed
some
really
racist
sentiments
to
flourish
and
i
think
its
detrimental
to
any
discussion
on
race
because
it
allows
for
a
white
students
opinion
to
be
ignored
and
given
no
weight
just
because
of
their
skin
color
i'm
hearing
all
this
back
and
forth
about
the
article
and
in
the
catalyst
and
i
think
that
honestly
everybody's
a
little
in
the
wrong
yes
the
article
could
have
been
written
better
and
shouldn't
have
attacked
the
people
it
did
without
first
discussing
it
with
them
to
at
least
present
their
side
from
what
i've
been
told
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
a
response
after
the
article
was
written
but
unfortunately
the
article
was
submitted
too
late
for
the
need
for
a
rebuttal
to
be
fully
understood
or
completed
and
truthfully
yes
there
are
aspects
of
feminist
rhetoric
on
campus
that
do
need
changing
that's
generally
the
state
of
any
controversial
issue
on
campus
and
we
all
need
to
be
aware
of
that
and
to
try
to
move
forward
to
make
things
better
however
i
don't
think
the
other
side
fully
appreciates
all
the
things
feminists
do
on
campus
yes
people
may
feel
alienated
by
certain
wording
but
you
have
to
understand
that
the
monthly
rag
does
its
best
in
trying
to
inform
and
educate
in
the
way
that
they
know
how
it
doesn't
make
them
right
or
wrong
it
simply
is
a
point
of
view
my
point
is
i
get
it
you
feel
like
feminist
rhetoric
excludes
people
on
campus
it
doesn't
intend
to
but
that's
generally
the
nature
of
the
beast
if
you
actually
want
to
change
that
you
can't
just
write
an
angry
article
in
the
catalyst
defaming
feminism
on
campus
that
will
only
do
more
harm
than
it
can
ever
do
good
maybe
instead
of
taking
the
indirect
approach
maybe
get
involved
feminism
on
campus
won't
change
unless
you
change
with
it
and
help
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
everyone
so
take
a
feminist
and
gender
studies
class
attend
a
femco
meeting
step
outside
your
box
yes
it
will
be
difficult
because
oftentimes
we
are
set
in
our
ways
but
feminists
on
campus
want
to
work
with
you
they
aren't
scary
i
promise
you
have
to
be
willing
to
take
that
chance
and
try
to
make
a
change
because
i
can't
honestly
say
that
you
have
the
right
to
defame
an
underrepresented
voice
on
this
campus
if
you
aren't
willing
to
take
the
time
to
investigate
what
they
do
and
why
they
say
things
that
way
we
are
all
angry
and
everybody
is
entitled
in
their
own
way
the
question
is
are
we
actually
going
to
do
something
productive
with
that
anger
or
are
we
going
to
let
this
incident
fester
within
our
community
so
that
when
the
next
one
comes
around
all
we
can
think
to
do
is
lash
out
is
it
bad
that
i
actually
desperately
want
the
cc
makeout
twitter
account
to
take
off
any
girls
down
to
fuck
a
guy
with
a
strap
on
i
wanna
be
dominated
by
a
powerful
woman
10499
i
feel
i'm
not
in
love
with
my
boyfriend
anymore
but
i
don't
how
to
start
the
conversation
what
should
i
do
a
complete
stranger
just
asked
me
if
i
was
down
to
give
him
head
for
2000
im
seriously
considering
this
wtf
is
wrong
with
me
am
i
the
only
one
without
morals
16897
am
i
the
only
one
who
thought
that
math
2220
prelim
was
really
f
cking
hard
i
feel
like
i
am
slowly
losing
my
mind
i
haven't
been
to
a
couple
of
my
classes
in
weeks
even
though
i
know
i
should
go
because
i
need
to
do
well
on
the
exams
every
day
i
feel
like
i
am
diverging
farther
and
farther
from
who
i
thought
i
was
i
liked
that
girl
but
why
do
i
have
to
change
and
no
matter
how
hard
i
try
i
feel
like
i
can't
change
back
who
said
tac
doesn't
promote
themselves
at
the
memorial
there's
a
giant
damn
sign
with
all
their
contact
info
on
it
there
yeah
not
promoting
themselves
my
ass
myself
and
four
other
friends
all
took
turns
masturbating
in
my
roommates
bed
should
i
tell
him
why
is
it
that
when
you
want
autocorrect
to
fix
something
it
doesn't
but
when
you
don't
want
it
to
fix
something
it
does
i
mean
ducking
hekk
what
is
up
with
that
17380
why
is
it
so
hard
to
find
a
gay
guy
here
that
isn't
just
looking
for
a
hook
up
i
hate
the
hookup
culture
here
i
just
want
to
have
someone
to
cuddle
with
and
go
on
dates
with
exclusively
i
hooked
up
with
this
one
guy
who
failed
to
tell
me
that
he
has
a
girlfriend
four
days
later
i
found
out
that
i
had
had
mono
for
weeks
karma's
a
bitch
ain't
it
i
can't
wait
for
the
day
whether
it
be
15
years
or
50
that
our
children
grandchildren
will
be
just
confused
about
the
laws
forbidding
pedophilic
marriage
as
we
are
confused
about
the
laws
forbidding
interracial
marriage
i
remember
learning
about
the
civil
rights
movement
and
being
so
confused
as
to
why
black
people
couldn't
vote
why
black
and
white
kids
couldn't
use
the
same
water
fountain
why
the
races
weren't
equal
when
it
comes
to
pedophilia
it
shouldn't
be
done
they
still
say
wasn't
it
loving
v
virginia
1967
that
declared
marriage
was
one
of
the
basic
civil
rights
and
the
right
to
marry
was
a
fundamental
freedom
are
loving
and
consenting
children
and
adults
not
to
be
treated
equally
whether
you
agree
or
not
it's
a
question
of
equality
really
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
don't
agree
with
it
just
like
many
of
our
grandparents
or
great
grandparents
don't
agree
with
interracial
marriage
we
the
people
have
rights
and
as
an
american
i
personally
would
not
deny
minorities
the
freedoms
i
have
when
will
your
prejudices
stop
i
hope
they
will
when
your
child
or
grandchild
has
to
ask
why
was
the
world
such
an
unequal
place
april

2014
i'm
strongly
considering
changing
my
major
to
engineering
from
business
because
i
would
find
it
much
more
interesting
i
have
also
realized
thanks
to
an
internship
that
i
would
hate
having
a
desk
job
i'm
concerned
however
because
i
am
in
my
second
year
and
i
think
it
might
be
too
late
to
change
and
i'd
be
basically
starting
over
has
anyone
else
changed
majors
like
this
mid
career
i
wouldn't
mind
staying
an
extra
year
but
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
other's
opinions
advice

i
am
in
shock
after
hearing
that
most
students
in
my
program
at
nyu
buenos
aires
ask
their
parents
for
money
to
be
able
to
go
on
spring
break
in
different
countries
among
other
things
like
shopping
and
going
out
they
pay
for
your
tuition
and
board
isn't
that
enough
some
people
need
to
grow
up
and
get
a
job
stop
calling
people
pucksluts
it's
tacky
and
none
of
your
business
tee
hee
then
have
some
fucking
dignity
and
don't
be
a
puckslut
if
you're
in
a
committed
relationship
with
someone
who
happens
to
be
on
the
hockey
team
then
why
would
anyone
bother
to
comment
on
that
when
you
act
whoreishly
and
dumb
yourself
down
to
meet
the
expectations
of
someone
who's
probably
going
to
stay
at
this
school
for
two
years
until
they
go
live
the
life
of
a
superstar
people
are
going
to
talk
shit
because
that's
not
what
we're
about
here
stand
the
fuck
up
for
yourself
booyouwhore
this
guy
bought
me
drinks
all
night
both
times
we
went
out
with
a
group
is
there
any
reason
why
he
wouldn't
accept
a
friend
request
on
facebook
i
can't
believe
i
am
being
one
of
those
girls
i
thought
we
hit
it
off
15327
is
it
bad
that
i
enjoy
giving
head
532
i
am
starting
to
really
get
sick
of
all
of
this
condescension
of
people
of
certain
majors
over
others
really
sick
of
it
why
must
we
try
to
rank
the
difficulty
or
importance
of
some
majors
and
effectively
people
over
others
everyone
has
something
to
contribute
in
this
world
and
we
need
people
to
enjoy
what
they
do
too
many
people
here
and
everywhere
else
have
been
influenced
to
pursue
paths
in
math
or
science
just
because
it
is
perceived
as
respected
by
the
general
population
it
is
a
shame
how
people
who
want
to
study
the
liberal
arts
often
feel
embarrassed
about
what
they
study
and
what
they
want
to
do
in
life
they
are
disrespected
by
their
peers
and
sometimes
even
their
own
parents
look
down
on
what
they
want
to
do
to
those
of
you
who
fit
that
description
i
say
you
should
forget
what
everyone
thinks
says
and
do
what
makes
you
happy
to
be
happy
you
don't
need
to
be
a
doctor
or
an
engineer
or
whatever
else
you
have
been
taught
to
be
the
definition
of
success
you
don't
need
to
be
in
the
sciences
and
you
don't
even
need
to
make
a
lot
of
money
many
are
happy
with
less
including
smart
people
who
could
have
done
more
let
people
do
what
they
love
without
being
criticized
for
it
this
culture
has
sickened
me
and
i
wish
it
would
stop
by
the
way
this
is
all
coming
from
a
stem
major
i
saw
a
car
driving
today
with
a
tamu
liberal
arts
sticker
on
the
back
is
that
something
to
brag
about
or
something
i
laughed
so
hard
7191
i
think
my
boyfriend
is
in
the
closet
we
recently
started
dating
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
how
do
i
approach
this
guys
seem
to
be
intimidated
by
me
i'm
not
bad
looking
but
i
am
builtpretty
stout
and
am
taller
than
most
guys
are
guys
intimidated
by
bigger
girls
like
myself
i
have
been
texting
this
guy
on
and
off
since
after
spring
break
and
we've
hooked
up
a
couple
of
times
and
flirt
all
the
time
i
found
out
that
he
has
been
dating
this
girl
for
about
a
month
now
we
haven't
hooked
up
in
the
past
month
but
he
has
been
texting
me
saying
he
wants
to
sleep
with
me
and
see
me
and
has
been
trying
to
hang
out
with
me
but
something
always
ends
up
not
working
out
is
it
my
place
to
say
anything
to
her
or
should
i
just
let
it
be
i
had
a
dream
last
night
in
which
you
stormed
up
to
me
pointed
in
the
general
direction
of
someone
i
couldn't
see
and
said
quite
angrily
you're
sleeping
with
him
i
was
bewildered
what
are
you
talking
about
you're
sleeping
with
him
he
reiterated
with
emphasis
on
him
um
no
no
i'm
not
your
face
looked
confused
then
softened
and
you
walked
off
without
another
word
later
you
came
up
to
me
as
i
was
about
to
walk
home
sorry
i
was
so
harsh
you
said
why
did
you
get
so
mad
you
averted
your
eyes
then
you
looked
straight
at
me
into
my
pupils
down
my
optic
nerve
past
my
lateral
geniculate
nucleus
and
right
at
the
upside
down
image
of
you
staring
back
at
me
staring
back
at
you
like
the
infinity
you
see
in
mirrors
facing
each
other
you
smiled
and
put
your
arm
around
me
then
you
walked
me
home
what's
the
best
tattoo
parlor
in
the
springs
why
does
everyone
hate
on
fraternity
men
just
because
they
dress
nice
know
how
to
talk
to
women
and
are
historically
more
successful
doesn't
give
you
a
reason
to
call
them
douche
bags
all
the
time
you
just
don't
know
any
of
them
personally
my
boyfriend
and
i
have
been
dating
for
almost
2
years
now
a
few
months
ago
he
asked
if
i
would
be
okay
with
him
farting
in
front
of
me
i
told
him
sure
i'd
be
fine
with
you
doing
that
occasionally
just
don't
do
it
all
the
time
you
know
go
to
the
bathroom
to
do
it
once
in
a
while
he
agreed
well
he's
gotten
a
little
too
comfortable
with
farting
around
me
and
now
he
farts
all
the
time
like
every
5
seconds
all
the
time
and
last
night
while
we
were
sleeping
he
farted
on
my
butt
followed
by
a
quite
statement
of
embrace
the
fart
winner

d
that
robbie
adler
though
single
i'm
in
a
relationship
with

cc
we
like

weird

that
on
a
scale
from
1
to
10
hey
guys

a
transfer
for
the
fall
from
ut
el
paso
to
a
m
i'm
an
indian
male
can
anybody

what
the
scene
is
like
for
indian
asians
at
texas
a
m
please

if
i
will

racism
my
father
wants
me

what's
your
opinion
on
the
best
beer
to
ring
dunk
with
i'm
currently
on
the
red
line
back
to
nu
and
i
have
to
take
the
hugest
shit
this
is
a
significant
problem
tips
on
how
to
resolve
everyone
knows
that
hooking
up
with
one
of
your
good
friends
can
be
a
bad
idea
but
i
did
it
anyway
why
hormones
aaaaaaaaand
i
wanna
do
it
again
yolo
10670
does
anybody
listen
to
dire
straits
on
this
campus
money
for
nothing
is
the
best
song
in
history
14515
i
no
nothing
of
economics
or
government
policies
so
my
opinions
may
be
in
the
wrong
here
but
what
i
hate
about
some
of
my
friends
are
their
arguments
for
the
following
people
say
that
drugs
should
be
legalized
and
taxed
heavily
in
order
to
curb
their
sales
in
the
u.s
and
other
sovereign
nations
what
i
don't
understand
is
wouldn't
this
just
force
drug
dealers
to
go
ahead
and
continue
their
sale
of
products
on
the
black
market
at
independent
prices
with
disregard
to
government
tariffs
so
now
you
have
a
situation
where
drugs
are
still
being
sold
but
it
is
harder
for
police
to
apprehend
dealers
since
the
substance
they
have
on
their
body
is
now
legal
also
when
friends
of
mine
by
weed
don't
they
realize
where
this
shit
comes
from
their
demand
for
this
product
is
basically
fueling
a
system
where
their
money
is
trickling
down
to
those
colombian
and
columbian
drug
bastard
mob
bosses
who
ruin
children's
lives
if
you
really
want
to
smoke
this
shit
then
you
should
ball
up
and
grow
it
yourself
i
personally
smoke
plastics
also
i
also
like
you
14496
love
shoving
a
colorful
assortment
of
vegetables
up
my
anus
and
pretending
i
have
a
cool
tail
you
seem
fun
we
should
meet
up
some
time
4860
can
someone
please
explain
to
my
why
wifi
in
stern
is
only
for
stern
students
14659
so
the
other
day
i
was
in
the
bushes
watching
my
girlfriend
come
back
home
she
was
walking
with
another
dude
she
kissed
the
man
on
the
lips
before
going
into
the
house
later
i
confronted
her
about
it
and
she
swore
that
he
was
just
a
friend
and
that
a
kiss
on
the
lips
in
america
is
the
same
thing
it
is
in
europe
where
i'm
from
i
really
want
to
marry
this
girl
so
the
question
i
want
to
ask
is
is
this
true
is
a
kiss
in
america
just
a
friendly
thing
i
mean
it
was
kind
of
passionate
30
second
kiss
and
he
then
slaps
her
playfully
on
the
ass
maybe
i'm
just
overreacting
or
maybe
i'm
tied
down
to
eh
what
you
americanos
call
a
hoe
please
help
me
i
really
love
this
bitch
and
enjoy
sleeping
with
her
i'm
really
tired
of
people
who
diss
flos
and
say
it's
new
army
shit
i
love
my
flo
to
death
and
we
do
tons
to
help
the
community
and
participate
in
all
the
a
m
traditions
granted
there
may
be
a
few
exceptions
that
give
flos
a
bad
name
it's
the
same
way
in
any
other
organization
i
don't
get
why
someone
would
ostracize
a
group
for
trying
to
make
a
difference
we
are
the
aggies
the
aggies
are
we
1393
to
the
new
hercampus
campus

actually
perfect
and

center

want
you
951
i've
been
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
i'm
struggling
so
much
with
my
recent
breakup
i
thought
they
were
it
and
it's
shocking
to
just
lose
them
completely
how
am
i
supposed
to
feel
when
will
this
get
better
every
day
things
just
feel
a
little
bit
worse
i'm
going
to
be
forever
alone
16803
my
roommate
is
a
super
introverted
engineering
student
that
never
initiates
conversations
with
me
he
is
super
organized
and
clean
but
one
thing
that
really
annoys
me
is
that
he
just
openly
farts
every
night
in
our
room
what
should
i
do
does
anyone
remember
doing
reports
on
shakespeare
in
middle
highschool
and
breaking
down
the
sentence
structure
and
discussing
the
hidden
meanings
of
the
book
well
when
i
get
really
high
and
watch
tv
i
do
the
same
thing
to
whatever
tv
show
or
movie
i'm
watching
on
the
outside
it
looks
like
i'm
silently
watching
tv
on
the
inside
i
am
debating
with
myself
why
the
creator
chose
to
present
the
show
the
way
they
did
and
what
life
lessons
they
are
trying
to
deliver
to
the
audience
1081
when
i
saw
all
of
the
dp
candidates
bitching
after
they
lost
i
laughed
i
laughed
even
harder
when
some
of
them
even
had
the
nerve
to
vent
their
frustrations
on
facebook
you
can
say
you
are
upset
because
of
the
lack
of
representation
of
minority
groups
or
whatever
but
i
know
that
isn't
the
only
reason
the
truth
is
you
are
embarrassed
that
opp
swept
you
guys
across
the
board
the
truth
is
you
are
angry
that
you
put
in
so
much
time
and
received
no
return
from
it
i
laugh
at
you
because
you
are
trying
to
put
the
fault
on
the
voters
rather
than
acknowledging
your
and
your
parties
inadequacies
shame
on
me
for
not
voting
for
your
party
shame
on
you
for
running
candidates
who
won't
attract
votes
shame
on
you
for
running
a
terrible
campaign
shame
on
you
for
trying
to
blaming
others
for
your
failures
at
least
have
some
dignity
in
your
loss
instead
of
pouting
like
children
to
michaelia
stephens
i
am
so
in
love
with
you
sometimes
i
follow
you
to
your
dorm
after
class
just
to
watch
you
walk
i
took
a
picture
of
you
in
class
and
brought
it
to
centry
tree
i
never
thought
i
could
feel
this
way
i
tried
to
tell
you
but
it
felt
like
you
didn't
really
get
it
you're
just
so
tiny
i
want
to
grab
you
from
behind
pick
you
up
from
behind
and
swing
you
around
i
want
to
build
beautiful
arcehetecture
and
put
your
face
on
it
you
make
my
mind
feel
like
candy
but
you
won't
even
sit
near
me
talk
to
me
anymore
gosh
i
just
wanna
whip
out
my
penis
and
show
it
to
you
i
love
you
michaelia

james
tawney
you're
so
freaking
cute
and
not
only
because
of
those
mixed
japanese
features
of
yours
mm
how
i'd
love
to
spread
my
wasabi
on
your
sashimi
i
wish
all
the
hot
guys
i
know
weren't
taken
this
is
getting
depressing
are
there
any
single
tall
super
strong
guys
with
sea
blue
eyes
and
nice
personalities
left
in
this
world
i
fucking
hate
my
best
friend's
boyfriend
he's
seriously
ruining
her
life
and
she
doesn't
even
realize
it
why
do
such
beautiful
girls
inside
and
out
date
such
horrible
boys
i'm
a
21
year
old
senior
and
have
never
had
a
girlfriend
which
to
some
extent
i
feel
like
is
alright
because
my
grades
are
very
in
check
i'm
in
shape
and
i
have
a
solid
group
of
friends
but
now
that
my
college
career
is
wrapping
up
i
feel
like
it's
time
i
went
ahead
and
tried
to
make
something
happen
where
could
i
maybe
go
to
meet
someone
or
maybe
i
should
ask
where
did
you
guys
meet
your
s
o
or
ex
s
o
my
friends
are
all
lazy
and
never
want
to
go
out
and
do
anything
anymore
so
i
feel
like
unless
i
try
something
new
i'll
never
really
meet
anyone
not
to
mention
i'm
in
engineering
and
the
women
situation
there
is
just
nonexistent
haha
thanks
guys
so
i've
been
thinking
about
joining
bonfire
but
i
don't
really
enjoy
spending
time
with
people
who
are
super
sexist
racist
homophobic
and
i
just
saw
some
comments
on
this
page
that
made
me
wonder
are
the
people
in
bonfire
like
that
i
hate
going
out
and
seeing
a
group
of
friends
who
entirely
ignore
each
other
and
just
play
on
their
respective
smartphone
you
go
out
with
your
friends
to
be
social
right
not
to
text
your
so
the
whole
time
google
pictures
of
celebrities
search
for
the
latest
details
on
the
royal
baby
or
scour
fan
forums
for
the
most
exclusive
spoilers
for
the
next
season
of
the
walking
dead
one
would
think
your
bestfriend
was
siri
asking
her
to
do
all
these
searches
and
commands
yet
if
i
checked
your
call
log
there
wouldn't
be
a
freaking
call
in
it
first
and
foremost
it's
a
phone
for
christ's
sake
how
the
hell
do
you
socialize
at
all
put
your
phone
on
silent
or
better
yet
don't
take
it
at
all
go
out
to
dinner
or
dancing
with
your
friends
and
actually
talk
and
hang
out
get
to
know
one
another
and
sympathize
when
necessary
or
even
meet
some
new
people
i
truly
fear
for
the
day
when
talking
to
someone
solely
for
the
sake
of
getting
to
know
them
disappears
and
we're
left
with
a
bunch
of
anti
social
idiots
any
news
on
whether
unh
is
setting
up
blood
drives
in
the
upcoming
days
it's
been
an
entire
year
since
we
broke
up
and
i
still
can't
get
over
you
we
haven't
hung
out
in
quite
a
while
but
we
text
occasionally
it's
not
like
we
dated
for
more
than
6
months
so
why
are
you
still
stuck
in
my
head
i
missed
4
20
on
4
20
sigh
i
guess
i'll
never
know
the
feeling
of
just
blazing
there's
always
next
year
right

i
change
pronouns
in
a
lot
of
my
love
related
confessions
because
i'm
gay
i'm
not
ashamed
of
it
but
historically
once
i've
disclosed
my
sexuality
in
a
post
that's
all
people
can
focus
on
i
don't
get
the
same
kind
of
dating
advice
or
support
from
the
cornell
community
because
people
are
too
tripped
up
on
my
sexuality
to
even
realize
i
have
relationship
problems
too
it's
not
like
the
cornell
community
is
being
malicious
or
that
they
can't
understand
it's
just
that
my
confession
get's
lost
under
all
the
hustle
bustle
of
being
gay
if
people
knew
how
hard
it
was
to
be
gay
here
i
think
they
would
take
it
a
bit
more
seriously
you
think
you
guys
have
trouble
finding
a
serious
relationship
imagine
having
a
population
about
1
10th
the
size
to
work
with
now
imagine
having
to
deal
with
the
social
stigma
of
being
gay
once
you
actually
do
find
someone
you're
interested
in
how
many
times
have
you
seen
two
guys
kissing
in
public
or
even
holding
hands
i'm
not
saying
that
gay
couples
don't
do
those
things
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
really
difficult
being
gay
here
much
harder
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i'm
a
very
open
happy
and
well
liked
person
on
campus
but
i'm
very
lonely
sometimes
i
am
so
sad
about
graduating
from
cornell
but
i'm
hoping
it'll
open
a
new
chapter
in
my
romantic
life
here's
to
hoping

speaking
of
interracial
relationships
i'm
a
latino
and
i
date
white
girls
almost
exclusively
latinas
on
occasion
they're
usually
bored
of
plain
ol
white
boys
want
to
experience
a
different
culture
and
like
it
when
i
speak
to
them
in

where
are

i
just
want
to
watch

and
chill
what
the
heck
is
a
problem
set

do
other
girls
watch
porn
as
much
as
i
do
how
many
of
y'all
would
be
interested
if
possible
in
creating
an
organization
here
at
a
m
for
open
carry
of
long
rifles
it
would
be
similar
to
what
oct
is
doing
is
fashion
show
not
happening
this
year
my
mom
bought
this
vile
piece
of
hatred
and
cultural
appropriation
i
try
to
educate
her
but
i
worry
that
she
will
always
be
a
subhuman
bigot
maybe
if
i
socially
ostracize
her
and
prevent
her
from
speaking
to
me
she
will
gain
some
empathy
i'm
so
glad
i
can
find
true
family
at

anyways
paul
newman
is
a
racist
white
egotist
who
thinks
that
donating
to
charity
absolves
him
of
responsibility
doesn't
this
sound
familiar
don't
buy
his
products
you
must
not
be
frightened
if
sadness
rises
up
before
you
larger
than
any
you
have
ever
seen
if
a
restiveness
like
light
and
cloudshadows
passes
over
your
hands
and
over
all
you
do
you
must
think
that
something
is
happening
within
you
that
life
has
not
forgotton
you
it
holds
you
in
its
hand
it
will
not
let
you
fall
why
would
you
want
to
exclude
from
your
life
any
uneasiness
any
pain
any
depression
since
you
don't
know
what
work
they
are
accomplishing

you

does
true
love
exist
do
people
even
deeply
care
about
one
another
anymore
beyond
passing
crushes
and
lust
i
just
feel
numb
and
sad
not
lonely
but
just
as
if
maybe
it
really
doesn't
exist
not
being
a
melodramatic
moody
or
overly
sensitive
but
honest
i
don't
give
up
but
time
and
time
again
i
find
that
heartache
is
inevitable

why
in
the
world
would
a
professor
assign
a
presentation
a
prelim
and
a
paper
before
break
more
specifically
why
are
we
having
a
prelim
this
tuesday
before
break
if
professors
really
cared
they
would
realize
they
are
not
the
only
ones
who
teach
at
cornell
it's
so
annoying
and
stressful
why
can't
i
just
take
it
as
a
final
and
do
well
instead
of
cramming
now
and
failing
i
would've
loved
to
manage
my
time
better
but
wait
i
have
other
assignments
due
before
break

hating
all
these

is
less

i
never
got
the
whole
poking
thing
on
facebook
i
always
thought
it
signified
that
the
guy
wants
to
get
in
my
pants
so
do
guys
poke
girls
for
this
reason
or
not
sadly
i
am
being
serious
i
have
always
been
somewhat
standoffish
towards
guys
to
avoid
getting
hurt
now
i
have
come
to
the
decision
to
not
care
anymore
not
question
him
what
his
intentions
are
not
wonder
if
he
is
just
using
me
etc
what
is
the
point
anymore
of
trying
to
stay
true
to
myself
when
that
ends
up
in
no
relationship

why
is
everyone
addicted
to
buzzfeed
during
finals
why
do
all
the
posts
have
to
be
about
vibrators
and
privilege
do
guys
find
girls
that
are
pretty
but
also
smart
to
be
intimidating
or
less
attractive
i
just
want
to
be
done
with
college
so
i
can
start
my
career
in
the
u.s
army
i
couldn't
really
care
less
about
half
the
crap
i'm
learning
in
college
and
i
feel
like
ill
actually
enjoy
learning
in
the
different
schools
ill
have
to
attend
while
in
the
army
i
do
however
understand
the
importance
of
having
a
degree
and
i
want
to
have
something
to
fall
back
on
in
case
something
happens
in
the
unforeseen
future
does
anybody
else
feel
similar
my
masturbation
or
sex
stamina
is
just
once
per
day
and
no
more
so
girls
stop
negotiating
with
me
for
more
sex
alright
16325
i'm
just
a
virgin
guy
who
wants
to
have
sex
i
don't
have
a
girlfriend
and
i'm
too
overweight
to
get
hookups
what
do
i
do
if
an
attractive
girl
tells
you
she
is
a
virginis
that
more
or
less
attractive
1664
when
i'm
having
sex
with
a
guy
and
he
wants
to
have
anal
sex
i'm
thinking
really
is
my
vagina
not
tight
enough
for
you
ugh

i
cheated
on
my
girlfriend
out
of
school
with
a
friend
of
mine
here
the
worst
part
is
i
don't
feel
bad
about
it
i
love
my
girlfriend
and
my
friend
and
i
just
decided
to
not
talk
about
it
again
i
feel
like
some
sort
of
psychopath
because
i
don't
feel
bad
when
i
get
away
with
things
that
are
wrong
i
guess
i
know
i
love
my
girlfriend
we
are
both
happy
no
one
really
seemed
hurt
by
it
why
would
i
destroy
our
happiness
by
telling
someone
i
know
i'm
supposed
to
feel
bad
and
i
know
i
want
to
know
if
i
was
in
my
girlfriend's
position
but
it
just
seems
like
the
worst
thing
to
do
1136
can
someone
please
tell
me
what
is
the
big
deal
about
freebirds
i
only
ate
there
once
as
a
student
and
twice
in
the
four
years
since
i
graduated
including
this
alumni
weekend
is
there
something
i'm
missing
i'm
a
junior
and
i
have
no
friends
i
greet
people
in
passing
but
have
no
idea
how
to
go
from
being
friendly
with
people
to
hanging
out
with
them
what
do
i
do
154
i
am
almost
paralyzed
by
anxiety
on
a
daily
basis
in
regards
to
my
future
my
student
loans
and
the
financial
stress
that
i'm
placing
on
my
family
to
attend
college
my
parents
can
pass
the
credit
check
needed
to
get
the
loans
but
i
don't
know
if
they
can
afford
to
pay
them
back
worse
i
don't
know
if
they
understand
just
how
much
debt
i'll
incur
by
the
time
i
graduate
from
law
school
sometimes
i
consider
dropping
out
because
then
at
least
i'll
stop
accumulating
debt
but
if
i
do
that
i'll
definitely
have
no
way
to
help
them
repay
the
5
figure
debt
i've
already
incurred
by
the
end
of
my
second
year
of
college
i'm
trapped
on
the
path
i
already
chose
sometimes
i'm
idly
suicidal
because
if
i
die
the
debt
would
be
forgiven
but
i
couldn't
do
that
to
my
family
and
friends
no
i've
made
my
bed
i
know
they
want
me
to
achieve
great
things
and
i
want
to
live
up
to
their
expectations
and
my
own
and
i
know
their
number
one
concern
is
that
i'm
happy
and
successful
but
i
don't
think
i'm
worth
the
confidence
they
place
in
me
i
think
i'm
depressed
but
i
feel
as
if
i
have
no
right
to
be
depressed
there
are
people
with
lives
many
times
worse
than
my
own
who
am
i
to
let
such
relatively
petty
concerns
drag
me
down
i'm
stressed
convinced
of
my
own
weakness
and
inferiority
consumed
by
self
loathing
for
feeling
bad
over
relatively
nothing
and
i
just
can't
stop
thinking
about
what
will
happen
when
those
loans
need
to
be
repaid
i
stopped
looking
forward
to
the
future
a
long
time
ago
because
it
has
nothing
good
in
store
for
my
family
and
i
admin
says
i
know
this
is
a
lot
more
depth
than
our
regularly
scheduled
programming
but
it's
a
cry
for
help
and
i
think
a
lot
of
us
can
relate
i'm
no
expert
and
i
don't
know
your
situation
but
it
sounds
like
if
you
aren't
already
you
need
to
be
letting
all
this
out
to
somebody
you
must
to
have
confessed
it
most
people
get
depressed
periodically
whether
they
have
a
right
to
be
or
not
you're
not
doing
anyone
any
good
by
hurting
right
even
idle
suicidal
thoughts
are
important
and
as
a
student
you
can
see
the
counselors
here
for
free
their
number
is
503

i'm
not
trying
to
patronize
you
obviously
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
this
community
is
here
for
you
hope
this
helps
337
i
have
no
interest
in
partying
drugs
or
getting
drunk
and
doing
stupid
things
i
just
want
to
bake
craft
and
watch
netflix
where
are
all
the
mellow
ladiez
re
all
the
confessions
being
copied
from
csu's
confession
page
i
wondered
about
that
too
whoever
did
it
why
i
love
how
racist
white
people
here
are
so
against
other
cultures
yet
so
willing
to
eat

i've
always
wanted
to
date
a
white
guy
where
are
the
white
guys
with
jungle
fever
18664
i
think
i'm
falling
in
love
with
my
best
friend
problem
is
she's
a
straight
girl
and
i'm
a
straight
girl
i
have
these
fantasies
about
her
actually
being
gay
and
us
becoming
a
couple
but
i
highly
doubt
it
will
ever
happen
but
how
do
i
contain
my
emotions
14790
i'm
not
the
type
of
guy
who's
superstitious
or
religious
but
i
swear
that
my
house
is
haunted
for
the
summer
i'm
living
alone
in
this
rickety
old
house
at
night
when
i'm
about
to
go
to
sleep
i
keep
hearing
sounds
like
someone
is
walking
around
i
always
go
and
check
the
rooms
but
no
one's
there
ever
occasionally
i
even
hear
some
mumbling
or
moans
like
someone
is
trying
to
get
my
attention
twice
i've
felt
someone
tug
at
my
clothes
when
i
entered
the
bathroom
a
couple
of
times
my
phone's
gone
missing
and
i've
always
found
it
in
the
same
spot
in
the
bathroom
near
the
toilet
wtf
and
last
tuesday
when
i
went
to
sleep
i
felt
like
something
was
in
the
bed
beside
me
sleeping
alongside
me
so
to
remedy
all
of
this
i've
started
smoking
copious
amounts
of
weed
and
consuming
unhealthy
amounts
of
alcohol
now
if
i
feel
something
hear
something
or
see
something
i
just
start
laughing
and
throwing
shit
at
it
pulling
out
my
dick
and
pissing
all
over
the
floor
i
scream
f
ck
the
world
and
go
to
sleep
with
no
regrets
at
all
i
hate
impact
camp
and
the
majority
of
people
that
attended
and
that
were
counselors
i
felt
like
everything
was
superficial
and
fake
the
first
day
i
will
not
forget
how
offending
it
was
listening
to
my
ignorant
bg
mom
counselor
talk
about
how
bad
fish
camp
was
because
there
were
gays
tattoos
and
gauges
i
felt
like
i
couldn't
talk
to
a
single
guy
in
the
camp
without
feeling
like
a
whore
because
there
was
gender
segregation
and
lots
of
it
they
had
like
three
bible
studies
a
day
kill
me
i'm
not
an
atheist
but
i
just
felt
like
people
were
shoving
bibles
down
my
throat
it
made
me
so
uncomfortable
and
they
placed
the
emphasis
on
guilting
people
into
loving
god
and
acting
like
you
had
to
be
a
certain
way
to
be
loved
by
him
rather
than
expressing
god's
universal
love
for
all
people
as
all
sins
are
equal
i
just
could
not
stand
it
and
coming
to
a
m
that
bad
experience
makes
me
avoid
church
and
i
still
can't
even
go
because
every
time
i
go
someone
mentions
impact
and
how
great
it
was
and
i'm
just
like
that
was
the
worst
week
of
my
life
and
my
parents
forced
me
to
go
i
was
hoping
the
christian
community
at
a
m
would
be
accepting
but
all
it
is
is
superficial
people
that
go
to
breakaway
and
sing
like
they
love
god
and
then
sin
constantly
while
condemning
people
with
gays
tattoos
and
gauges
and
anyone
else
who
doesn't
fit
their
stereotype
as
the
right
type
of
christian
i
wish
i
could
commit
to
a
church
but
almost
all
the
christians
here
seem
fake
and
even
saying
i'm
christian
to
anyone
makes
me
ashamed
because
i
don't
want
them
to
associate
me
with
those
types
of
people
oh
and
as
a
note
to
my
impact
camp
for
all
of
you
who
thought
i
was
shy
and
quiet
i'm
actually
really
loud
and
crazy
and
goofy
and
fun
y'all
just
never
saw
that
because
of
how
utterly
uncomfortable
i
was
but
my
fish
camp
sure
did
i
made
my
best
friends
there
not
to
mention
i'm
a
counselor
now
so
how
about
them
nuggets
in
conclusion
how
about
all
you
impact
christians
hop
out
of
your
bubbles
and
look
beyond
the
surface
to
see
people
for
who
they
are
and
try
to
make
a
friend
without
bringing
up
god
in
the
conversation

it
were
okay
for

save

dear

why
the

you
not
have

it
would
be
really
nice
not
to
have
to

twenty
fucking
times
a
day
sincerely
everyone
ever
who
has
had
this
problem
heres
a
little
ish
story
for
you
ags
i
have
been
single
since
coming
to
a
m
i'm
a
junior
i'm
not
complaining
i'm
single
by
choice
i
like
being
single
i've
got
big
dreams
i'm
working
towards
and
it's
going
to
take
someone
pretty
special
to
really
get
my
attention
i
did
however
meet
someone
who
fit
that
description
last
year
i
had
a
lab
with
him
he
caught
my
eye
right
away
tall
dark
and
sexy
as
hell
his
voice
was
like
honey
and
he
had
such
a
warmth
to
his
laugh
i'm
not
going
to
sit
here
and
pretend
i
knew
a
whole
lot
about
him
i
saw
him
once
a
week
and
we
never
had
any
real
deep
conversations
however
he
seemed
to
have
his
shit
together
like
me
he
was
funny
well
rounded
and
very
smart
i
could
go
on
but
basically
if
i
wrote
down
what
it
would
take
for
me
to
give
up
my
single
status
he
appeared
to
match
every
bit
of
it
he
is
the
first
and
last
guy
since
my
ex
that
has
given
me
those
ridiculous
tingly
butterflies
now
i've
been
told
i'm
attractive
i
was
a
late
bloomer
so
it's
still
a
bit
odd
for
me
to
hear
but
i'll
go
ahead
and
admit
that
i'm
not
bad
looking
people
also
seem
to
really
enjoy
my
company
as
well
i'm
a
jokester
i
live
on
other
peoples
laughter
even
if
it's
at
my
own
expense
here's
the
problem
when
i
like
someone
i
tend
to
get
super
duper
awkward
it's
like
being
tipsy
i
can
hear
how
stupid
i
sound
and
i
somehow
just
can't
stop
it
regardless
this
kid
still
seemed
to
like
me
and
i
will
say
that
i'm
usually
absolutely
oblivious
to
those
kinds
of
signs
but
it
seemed
obvious
i
tell
myself
it
was
all
in
my
head
try
to
convince
myself
he
didn't
like
me
back
but
when
i
really
think
about
it
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
he
had
to
have
been
at
least
a
little
attracted
to
mei
think
on
the
last
day
of
lab
i
finally
mustered
up
the
courage
to
give
him
my
number
which
says
something
because
i've
never
had
the
balls
to
make
the
first
move
i
just
knew
if
i
didn't
go
for
it
i'd
regret
it
i
must
have
written
my
number
on
a
sticky
note
half
a
dozen
times
because
i
hate
my
handwriting
and
it
didn't
look
pretty
enough
in
the
remaining
ten
minutes
of
class
the
panic
set
in
i
remember
him
talking
to
me
but
i
couldn't
hear
him
over
the
pounding
of
my
heart
i
walked
with
him
down
the
hall
after
class
and
when
he
turned
to
go
on
his
way
i
grabbed
his
hand
placed
the
sticky
note
in
it
and
choked
out
something
along
the
lines
of
if
you
ever
want
to
hang
out
some
time
with
what
was
an
attempt
at
a
seductive
smile
but
probably
looked
more
like
gas
he
smiled
that
gorgeous
smile
and
i
spun
around
before
i
could
barf
on
his
shoes
almost
ran
into
somebody
and
made
a
not
so
smooth
getaway
well
you
guessed
it
never
heard
from
him
idk
if
he
didn't
like
me
or
had
a
girlfriend
or
lost
my
number
or
what
i
don't
obsess
over
it
or
him
i'm
still
happy
to
be
single
and
it's
probably
for
the
best
but
i
think
about
it
every
now
and
then
and
wonder
and
wish
i'd
been
less
of
a
pussy
about
the
whole
thing
and
just
been
more
direct
not
having
an
answer
probably
bothers
me
more
than
the
rejection
haha
there
i
feel
better
proceed
with
the
quit
being
such
a
little
bitch
and
move
on
op
comments
what
do
michigan
and
minnesota
have
in
common
they'll
both
be
watching
wisconsin
on
tv
tomorrow
i
don't
know
what
to
do
ags
i'm
not
happy
with
my
boyfriend
anymore
i
want
to
break
up
with
him
but
it
would
crush
him
i
love
him
i
just
don't
feel
the
same
way
anymore
i
don't
even
know
how
to
explain
that
to
him
he
was
my
best
friend
before
we
started
dating
and
the
thought
of
him
hurting
or
not
having
a
friendship
at
all
with
him
scares
me
to
the
point
that
i've
just
stayed
in
this
unhappy
relationship
for
months
what
do
i
do
3630
there
is
a
girl
in
the
nhs
who
looks
like
kristen
bell
who
are
you
re
i
feel
like
something
has
changed
drastically
in
the
social
culture
at
cc
i
totally
agree
with
you
i
don't
know
what
it
is
either
but
something
is
off
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
used
to
think
our
social
culture
was
great
i
loved
it
as
a
whole
and
i
also
loved
the
niche
i
was
able
to
find
within
it
there
was
also
a
certain
feeling
you
got
just
by
being
on
campus
a
really
comfortable
and
sort
of
amused
feeling
something
about
social
life
here
was
so
uniquely
quirky
and
whimsical
and
fun
to
be
a
part
of
but
all
of
a
sudden
cc
feels
more
like
one
of
those
douchey
party
schools
than
anything
else
i
meet
fewer
and
fewer
fun
interesting
weird
in
a
good
way
people
and
it
seems
like
the
general
values
of
the
average
cc
student
have
changed
i
don't
feel
comfortable
and
i
don't
feel
amused
i
feel
kind
of
like
i
don't
belong
here
anymore
and
often
times
i'm
disappointed
or
annoyed
i
don't
know
does
this
sound
like
what
you
think
of
the
culture
shift
12432
i
really
want
to
hook
up
with
one
of
my
friends
but
i
don't
think
he's
getting
the
message
how
much
more
obvious
can
i
get
without
spelling
it
out
for
him
so
does
like
one
person
know
who
all
these
secrets
belong
to
niceee
allyson
dc
you
are
so
pretty
are
you
a
model
11662
as
a
prefrosh
how
bad
would
it
be
to
miss
the
first
two
days
of
orientation
week
if
you
aren't
religious
how
can
you
still
celebrate
easter
and
other
religious
holidays
i
find
this
contradicting
1164
1002
can't
emphasize
how
true
this
is
what
are
georgetown
girls
looking
for
ivy
leaguers
christ
we
already
go
here
isn't
that
enough
i
feel
as
though
every
girl
you
talk
to
already
judges
you
before
you
even
get
a
word
out
to
start
a
conversation
going
off
that
tangent
i
feel
like
everyone
over
analyzes
every
social
interaction
with
one
another
and
sure
that
comes
with
the
territory
as
we're
all
smart
and
aware
of
our
surroundings
but
that
being
said
people
need
to
stop
acting
like
24
7
junior
professionals
and
realize
that
we're
all
college
students
we're
here
to
have
a
good
time
sure
we
want
to
make
connections
and
get
those
hard
to
get
internships
etc
etc
but
let's
always
not
forget
to
have
fun
once
in
a
while
so
loosen
up
ladies
please
not
literally
of
course

how
is

i
thought

college
1639
there's
been
a
lot
of
abortion
talk
on
her
lately
and
i
just
wanna
say
that
once
i
started
asking
around
it
turned
out
like
more
than
half
of
everyone
i
know
had
an
abortion
i
had
one
too
i
think
if
we
all
started
talking
about
it
they
wouldn't
feel
so
shameful
i
felt
really
ashamed
for
like
two
years
i
would
cry
whenever
i
thought
about
it
it's
hard
also
to
tell
people
about
it
because
they
have
no
idea
what
the
situation
was
and
you
don't
know
if
they're
going
to
be
okay
with
it
or
if
they'll
secretly
think
you're
some
kind
of
monster
that's
the
worst
part
not
knowing
if
people
will
hate
you
or
not
or
if
you're
going
to
be
unsafe
around
them
because
they
seriously
think
you're
a
baby
killer
or
something
can
we
all
please
come
out
of
the
closet
at
least
post

so
i've
always
thought
i
was
gay
but
after
having
sex
several
times
i
realized
that
i
really
don't
like
it
i
just
don't
find
pleasure
in
it
i
really
want
to
have
sex
with
girls
and
i
feel
like
i'd
be
good
at
it
but
i
don't
know
where
to
start
plus
i
can
come
off
as
a
little
feminine
and
i
want
to
change
that
without
becoming
someone
i
don't
want
to
be
a
douchebag

my
girlfriend
thinks
i
cheated
on
her
because
two
other
girls
have
told
her
stories
yes
it
may
seem
like
i
did
from
the
stories
but
things
are
never
what
they
seem
i
have
never
even
grinded
with
another
girl
how
the
hell
do
i
have
the
courage
to
cheat
on
her
i
wish
there
was
a
nutrition
ta
here
that
could
answer
my
question
how
do
i
make
my
semen
taste
better
to
the
dick
at
the
rec
this
morning

did
no
one
in
your
life
ever
teach
you
not
to
cough
directly
into
the
air
seriously
what
the
f
ck
is
wrong
with
you
i
could
hear
all
the
phlegm
in
your
throat
yet
you
still
had
the
audacity
to
cough
in
mid
air
and
in
my
direction
i
would
appreciate
not
getting
sick
because
some
douche
has
no
manners
you
may
have
been
built
but
your
hygiene
seems
nonexistent
also
on
a
side
note
you're
hair
looked
greasy
oily
and
your
back
is
full
of
unnatural
acne
both
signs
of
steroid
use
you're
not
fooling
anyone

sometimes
i
feel
excluded
from
the
asian
community
is
it
really
because
i'm
too
americanized
don't
get
me
wrong
cause
i
love
all
my
friends
now
regardless
of
their
backgrounds
but
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
connect
with
my
culture
comfortably

trigger
warning

i
know
it's
fucked
but
i
have
hard
time
seeing
myself
as
acceptable
attractive
unless
i
am
at
least
at
least
20
lbs
under
my
medically
reccomended
bmi
but
here
i
am
drunkenly
eating

thus
i
will

i've
come
to
expect
the
impossible
of
myself
i
got
a
92
on
a
prelim
this
semester
and
sort
of
started
freaking
out
about
the
remaining
exams
i
was
dissapointed
with
my
95
on
another
prelim
i
have
received
nearly
all
of
the
credit
thus
far
in
another
class
and
yet
i'm
stressing
out
about
the
final
because
i
think
it's
going
to
be
graded
harshly
my
inability
to
accept
anything
less
than
perfection
is
interfering
with
my
quality
of
life
and
sometimes
even
paralyzes
me
to
the
point
of
killing
my
productivity
resulting
in
a
nasty
positive
feedback
loop
all
work
and
no
play
doesn't
just
make
jack
a
dull
boy
it
gives
him
tension
headaches
and
persistent
nausea
also
i
give
my
feels
to

i
met
this
girl
the
only
problem
she's
a
freshman
and
i
graduate
at
the
end
of
may
oh
i
guess
i
didn't
mention
i'm
a
senior
too
can
i
get
some
senioritis
over
here

i
need
to
get
out
this
weekend
so
much
stress
and
boredom
and
loneliness
i
need
to
do
something
exciting
for
once
i
have
no
friends
no
invites
no
idea
how
to
get
out
there
what
do
i
do
i
need
help

fuckfuckfuck
i
forgot
to
check
my
privilege
today
and
now
i
can't
find
it
i
think
i
left
it
in
the
dc
can
someone
go
look
how
can
i
tell
the
difference
between
a
guy
being
nice
to
me
and
a
guy
flirting
with
me
i
genuinely
feel
like
people
are
starting
to
shit
on
everyone
who
posts
a
confession
on
this
page
that
happens
to
diverge
with
the
view
of
the
majority
isn't
the
point
of
this
page
to
allow
for
open
expression
free

why

it
genuinely
confuses
me
that

it

i
am
so
disappointed
in
cornell
confessions
it's
what're
your
confessions
not
what's
your
confessions
i
go
through
the
self
checkout
line
at
the
grocery
store
and
type
in

for
cheaper

than
the
produce
i
have
in
my
basket
it's
pretty
much
stealing
i
can't
help
it
i'm
broke
and
hungry
does
this
make
me
a
bad
person
i
have
been
so
guilty
about
this
lately
92
college
is
a
place
that
is
experimental
but
would
it
hurt
to
find
any
descent
girls
to
bring
home
to
your
parents
like
someone
that
is
a
freak
in
the
sheets
but
an
angel
in
public
like
this
post
if
you
understand
where
i'm
coming
from
also
to
the
guy
or
girl
that
posted
about
underground
clubs
into
bdsm
i
laughed
my
ass
off
when
i
read
it
but
u
would
be
surprised
how
many
girls
are
into
that
stuff
u
just
have
to
look
into
the
geeky
girl
sexy
the
girls
that
u
don't
expect
to
be
freaky
at
all
and
next
thing
u
know
they
surprise
u
if
all
else
fails
the
dungeon
in
nyc
is
a
good
place
to
start
or
craigslist
lol
does
everyone
know
that
smokers
are
also
aware
of
the
health
effects
of
smoking
cause
it's
really
fucking
annoying
to
be
constantly
berrated
and
nagged
at
sometimes
by
total
strangers
on
this
campus
at
least
for
a
personal
choice
most
of
us
recognize
it's
a
shitty
choice
we
are
making
for
now
anyway
if
i'm
smoking
outside
and
i
don't
know
you
back
the
fuck
off
i
need
some
help
ags
so
there's
this
girl
who
i've
known
for
a
while
now
and
it's
painfully
obvious
that's
she's
come
to
like
me
and
i'll
admit
i've
led
her
on
a
bit
myself
she's
got
a
great
personality
and
understands
me
and
i
love
talking
to
her
but
there's
one
problem
that
i
hate
to
admit
i'm
not
physically
attracted
to
her
i
look
at
her
pictures
on
instagram
and
facebook
and
try
to
make
myself
think
she's
pretty
but
i
just
can't
and
i
know
that
make
me
sound
like
a
really
shallow
guy
but
it's
the
truth
i'm
not
too
sure
what
to
do
in
this
situation
because
i'm
pretty
sure
she
likes
me
and
she's
such
a
sweet
girl
and
i
know
it
would
break
her
heart
if
she
found
out
i
didn't
like
her
so
how
should
i
go
about
this
do
i
friendzone
her
if
so
how
do
i
take
one
for
the
team
and
go
on
a
date
with
her
she's
asked
me
out
to
dinner
and
lunch
but
i've
been
making
up
excuses
every
time
i'm
pretty
sure
she
doesn't
get
the
hint
what
should
i
do
do
you
even
remember
do
you
remember
how
even
though
you
weren't
too
big
on
the
romantic
gesture
i
still
found
ways
to
make
you
smile
when
we
spent
the
night
star
gazing
how
i
opened
up
to
you
like
i
have
to
no
one
before
how
i
broke
down
into
tears
talking
about
something
i've
never
talked
to
anyone
about
how
i
was
struggling
with
grades
losing
scholarships
despite
how
hard
i
was
working
how
stressed
out
and
manic
i
was
yea
i
screwed
up
but
i
immediately
apologized
and
tried
finding
ways
to
make
it
up
to
you
but
apparently
you
forgot
the
past
and
made
me
into
a
villain
then
you
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
me
you
burned
the
heart
out
me
you
know
who
you
are
you're
a
vile
woman
and
i
still
haven't
recovered

i'm
a
bisexual
guy
but
i
don't
even
bother

many
people

what
i
do
i
am
going
to
be
labled
gay
in
denial
i
know
my
guy
friends

i
can't

tension

days

play
lacrosse
i
was
raised
on
a
farm
i
like
women
i
am
still
the
same
person
but
i
am
just
getting
open
about
my
attraction
to
men
as
well
i'm
not
into
you
and
if
i
was
too
bad
you
are
straight
and
i
would
respect
that
you
do
not
feel
the
same
way
now
can
we
please
go
back
to
doing
guy

like
we
used
to

girls

sorority
that

as
a
clique
but
i
just

with
your
gf
or
bf
i
mean
really
im
kinda
tired
of
hearing
all
these
people
giving
people
shit
because
they
arent
being
faithful
or
whatever
its
an
intense
turn
on
and
leads
to
some
amazing
sex
might

say
give
it
a
shot

is

thirst
that
is
north
campus
those
freshmen
and
their
constant
need
for
sex
drugs
and
alcohol
is
unsettling
to
say
the
least
how
about
you
read
a
book
and
work
on
the
grades
huh

to
the

tables
wearing

shirt
i
don't
know
who
you
are
but
you
are
some
hot
stuff
it
always
makes
my
day
when
i'm
studying
at
the
tables
and
i
see
you
there
maybe
sign
up
for
more
hours
so
i
can
ogle
you
more
often

i
got
accepted
into

rit
and
a
few
other
universities
but
i
joined
nyu
cause
it
apparently
had
an
awesome
music
school
but
turns
out
poly
students
can
barely
use
any
of

and
i've
been
trying
to
start
a
funk
alternative
progressive
rock
band
for
a
year
now
i'm
frustrated
i
need
a
good
outlet
to
all
the
pressure
in
nyu
and
music
is
a
good
outlet
all
the
other
musicians
i
met
are
into
genres
like
pop
and
soft
rock
where
have
all
the
hardcore
people
gone
this
is
just
frustrating

are
there
any
corps
girls
who
are
interested
in
dating
a
non
corps
guy
no
this
isn't
some
bucket
list
item
i'm
not
a
boot
chaser
and
no
this
isn't
some
bet
or
dare
i
just
feel
like
the
mystery
behind
the
uniform
is
something
to
admire
everyday
we
men
are
able
to
see
non
crops
girls
dress
freely
usually
in
xxl
t
shirts
and
nike
shorts
but
that's
beside
my
point
i
feel
though
that
when
searching
for
a
diamond
in
the
ruff
it's
best
to
search
where
most
people
are
afraid
to
look
for
that
is
where
you
will
find
the
rarest
gem
of
all
guys
who
pee
all
over
the
toilet
seat
why
can
you
at
least
wipe
it
up
i
am
tired
of
cleaning
up
your
piss
every
time
i
go
to
the
bathroom
i
think
i
think
when
it's
all
over
it
just
comes
back
in
flashes
you
know
it's
like
a
kaleidoscope
of
memories
it
just
all
comes
back
but
he
never
does
i
think
part
of
me
knew
the
second
i
saw
him
that
this
would
happen
it's
not
really
anything
he
said
or
anything
he
did
it
was
the
feeling
that
came
along
with
it
and
the
crazy
thing
is
i
don't
know
if
i'm
ever
gonna
feel
that
way
again
but
i
don't
know
if
i
should
i
knew
his
world
moved
too
fast
and
burned
too
bright
but
i
just
thought
how
can
the
devil
be
pulling
you
toward
someone
who
looks
so
much
like
an
angel
when
he
smiles
at
you
maybe
he
knew
that
when
he
saw
me
i
guess
i
just
lost
my
balance
i
think
that
the
worst
part
of
it
all
wasn't
losing
him
it
was
losing
me

sometimes
i
will
have
sex
with
a
guy
or
give
him
a
blow
job
just
so
he
will
get
out
of
my
bed
and
i
can
sleep
i
may
be
a
cold
hard
bitch
but
i
hate
when
a
guy
wants
to
stay
and
cuddle
i
feel
like
an
intruder
in
my
own
bed
and
guys
always
steal
the
covers
and
push
me
towards
the
edge
i
need
my
sleep
when
i
can
get
it
so
if
getting
a
guy
off
is
what
it
takes
to
get
him
out
then
i
will
do
what
needs
to
be
done
besides
if
he
is
in
my
bed
then
i
wanted
him
there
at
one
point
for
a
reason
but
when
i'm
done
with
him
i
feel
that
it's
only
common
courtesy
for
him
to
leave
if
i
am
a
guest
i
always
leave
the
guy
to
sleep
peacefully
when
i'm
done
i'm
always
gone
before
morning
i
hate
lingerers
why
waste
a
perfectly
good
night
of
sleep
what
is
he
going
to
do
make
me
breakfast
date
me
let's
be
real
this
is
iv
cuddling
with
a
one
night
stand
is
dpass
and
pointless
the
worst
guys
are
the
ones
that
slime
their
way
into
my
bed
to
those
guys
i
straight
up
tell
them
i'm
not
fucking
you
get
the
fuck
out
i
mean
really
guys
have
a
little
self
respect
begging
is
not
attractive
and
persistence
is
just
another
word
for
annoying
my
bed
is
invitation
only
and
if
you
do
get
an
invite
be
a
polite

you
your

microwave
popcorn

fucking
cigarette
was
just
so
fucking
important
you
are
the
lowest
level
basic
piece
of

that
this

ever
made
the
mistake
of
accepting
you

do

keep

more
than
once
why
is
it
that
some
people
say
that
they
never
felt
poor
before
coming
to
kenyon
i
don't
see
anyone
flaunting
their
wealth
or
treating
people
differently
because
of
their
wealth
and
the
fact
that
i
don't
see
that
makes
me
worry

may
be

do

hi
i'm
a
normal
guy
but
sometimes
my
friend
and
i
like
to
touch
our
penises
together
and
kiss
a
little
the
bible
says
that
homosexuality
is
wrong
but
this
doesn't
make
me
gay
does
it
my
dog
died
this
winterbreak
he
was
a
7
year
old
beagle
my
neighbors
recently
got
a
german
shepard
and
the
dog
would
constantly
start
shit
with
my
dog
it
would
bark
and
my
dog
would
howl
back
and
my
neighbors
would
always
complain
to
us
about
it
a
week
and
a
half
ago
their
dog
jumped
over
the
wall
and
killed
my
dog
i
saw
it
all
happen
and
their
was
nothing
i
could
about
it
that
was
the
worst
part
i
went
and
yelled
at
the
neighbors
and
they
had
the
nerve
to
say
my
dog
instigated
the
fight
and
claiming
that
their
dog
wouldn't
hurt
a
fly
i
was
pissed
we
live
near
a
wooded
area
and
i
told
my
parents
a
wild
animal
must
have
attacked
him
i
didn't
report
it
i
wanted
to
deal
with
this
myself
a
few
days
ago
i
watched
their
house
and
waited
for
them
to
leave
once
they
left
i
made
sure
by
ringing
their
doorbell
several
times
and
not
being
answered
i
injected
a
large
amount
of
rat
poison
into
some
meat
and
fed
it
to
their
dog
i
did
this
every
twenty
minutes
with
different
pieces
of
meat
for
two
hours
and
their
dog
ate
it
up
i
watched
as
their
dog
became
sick
i
watched
as
the
family
did
all
they
could
to
save
it
i
watched
as
their
kids
cried
and
their
parents
grew
upset
i
watched
as
they
buried
their
dog
in
their
backyard
with
a
little
cross
on
it
and
you
know
what
it
felt
good
it
was
exhilarating
watching
the
hope
fade
from
their
faces
and
it
was
even
more
gratifying
seeing
that
dog
suffer
and
vomit
profusely
even
typing
this
i
start
to
feel
a
rush
of
excitement
i
got
revenge
and
it
felt
fantastic

16122
to
16109
please
get
out
of
my
life
as
if
it
isn't
bad
enough
that
you
had
to
post
this
travesty
of
a
confession
after
i
told
you
that
i
was
trying
to
forget
about
you
just
leave
please
just
leave
i
did
bottle
up
those
feelings
you're
right
here
they
go
this
is
my
confession
to
myself
so
i
can
get
them
out
a
great
portion
of
that
confession
is
a
lie
you
didn't
just
like
me
a
bit
and
only
at
the
beginning
you
didn't
even
rant
to
me
very
often
and
you
definitely
at
the
very
least
showed
me
far
more
affection
than
at
first
after
i
told
you
to
stop
talking
about
your
boyfriend
calling
every
single
night
and
falling
asleep
on
me
all
those
nights
if
you
didn't
like
me
then
i'd
have
to
say
you
were
very
good
at
manipulating
people
cause
that
is
extremely
obvious
then
you'd
talk
to
me
about
one
of
your
friends
being
manipulated
by
someone
else
and
feeling
bad
for
him
yeah
you
did
the
same
thing
but
don't
feel
bad
for
me
i'm
not
someone
you
should
pity
i
didn't
show
you
i
couldn't
tolerate
certain
aspects
of
you
that's
a
complete
and
utter
lie
i
was
asking
you
if
you
truly
wanted
to
share
with
me
what
you
shared
since
you
told
me
you
regret
telling
me
so
deeply
about
yourself
several
times
you
brought
up
this
concern
to
me
it
feels
like
every
time
i
share
something
personal
about
myself
or
my
friends
you
go
into
tmi
mode
and
i
assured
you
multiple
times
it
was
not
the
case
in
fact
i
even
reneged
on
my
request
for
you
not
to
talk
about
your
ex
since
you
talking
about
him
bothered
me
instead
of
this
being
something
you
could
compromise
on
you
turn
it
into
something
of
a
dealbreaker
and
lastly
this
friend
zone
is
ridiculous
i
wasn't
ever
in
the
friend
zone
until
about
2
weeks
ago
when
you
found
someone
to
replace
both
your
ex
and
what
you
wanted
me
to
be
at
least
that's
what
you
told
me
has
it
changed
again
like
everything
you
say
can
you
for
a
second
tell
me
the
truth
about
something
that
involves
me
you
know
i
wasn't
angry
at
you
till
you
wrote
this
extremely
insulting
confession
now
i'm
incensed
to
me
it
seems
obvious
that
you
were
writing
it
only
to
get
it
off
your
conscience
because
you
are
definitely
not
telling
the
truth
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
only
enjoyed
our
conversations
up
to
a
certain
point
afterwards
it
became
a
burden
a
chore
i
didn't
want
to
but
i
didn't
know
how
to
cut
my
emotional
losses
at
that
point
now
i
can
thanks
to
you
i
guess
someone
had
to
do
it
you
did
it
you
know
i
don't
think
i've
ever
detested
someone
that
i've
met
at
cornell
not
even
close
you
might
just
have
stolen
that
honor
though
you
said
you
still
care
about
me
right
don't
argue
with
me
then
don't
post
another
confession
don't
message
me
for
another
couple
years
don't
re
add
me
on
anything
i
just
now
removed
you
from
just
get
out
of
my
life
so
i
can
forget
you
and
everything
you
stand
for
already
17848
my
ex
cheated
on
me
and
manipulated
me
the
guy
i
was
into
before
him
raped
me
i
sure
know
how
to
pick
em
right
i
don't
think
i
ever
did
anything
bad
enough
to
deserve
being
so
blatantly
disrespected
i've
always
practiced
the
whole
treat
others
as
you
would
like
to
be
treated
thing
then
why
do
i
get
my
trust
violated
so
badly
i
don't
know
what
to
do
anymore
with
finals
approaching
we
need
to
all
take
some
time
to
keep
back
and
relax

so
who
else
has
had
his
or
her
existential
crisis
lately
why
are
nice
people
friends
with
such
assholes
i'm
tired
of
being
the
good
girl
it
seems
like
guys
don't
like
good
girls
they
like
sluts
more
than
the
good
girls
why
is
that
is
it
because
good
girls
are
prudes
to
the
plus
sized
girl
i'm
a
fan
how
can
i
find
you
i
got
kicked
out
the
college
of
science
what
do
i
do
im
lost
for
words
do
i
file
an
appeal
to
go
into
general
studies
2769
that
night
in
the
park
when
we
talked
until
3
00
am
even
after
everything
it
was
worth
it
9086
i
currently
am
crushing
on
a
girl
and
idk
what
to
do
to
try
to
move
it
forward
i
don't
talk
to
her
regularly
as
i
don't
really
see
her
often
but
whenever
we
do
we
always
laugh
and
have
great
conversations
i
don't
have
her
number
and
i'm
typically
a
shy
guy
so
i
probably
wouldn't
put
myself
out
there
even
though
i
think
i
should
any
suggestions
i'm
quite
frustrated
when
it
comes
to
trying
to
find
a
date
girlfriend
i
come
across
all
these
very
attractive
very
smart
girls
however
there
is
always
something
in
the
way
of
trying
to
get
a
date
with
them
its
always
one
thing
or
another
sometimes
its
a
girls
personality
she
might
be
flaky
and
be
very
vague
about
going
out
on
a
date
sometimes
i
just
have
bad
timing
i'll
ask
a
girl
out
and
she
just
got
out
of
a
relationship
sometimes
i'll
meet
a
girl
in
class
and
i
won't
act
until
the
last
minute
and
shes
gone
for
the
summer
and
sometimes
i'll
find
out
much
to
my
disappointment
that
she
is
already
in
a
relationship
why
can't
i
catch
a
break
i
just
want
an
attractive
intelligent
aggie
girl
that
i
could
have
the
possibility
of
marrying
one
day
but
with
my
luck
thus
far
i
don't
think
that'll
happen
12431
i
think
today
yesterday
was
my
most
productive
day
of
the
semester
5196
how
fucking
hard
is
it
for
nyu
students
to
be
considerate
and
not
sing
in
public
no
one
wants
to
listen
to
you
soooo
hey
admins
yes
yall
want
free
pieee
i'll
be
at
sweets
some
time
thursday
giving
out
free
pie
i'll
be
passing
it
out
to
random
people
too
so
you
will
still
remain
anonymous
to
me

also
applies
to
everyone
else

if
i
were
emotionally
available
and
believed
he
liked
me
i
would
jump
right
on
that
nice
looking
black
freshman
football
player
that
i'm
pretty
sure
lives
in
the
townhouses
no
question
in
my
mind
what's
his
name
1972
do
undergrads
hook
up
with
grad
students
or
are
grads
invisible
to
that
population
i
hate
how
a
regurgitation
of
the
professor's
ideas
seems
to
get
you
the
better
grade
than
a
critically
thought
out
thesis
sure
you
get
the
better
grade
in
the
short
term
but
it
only
forces
you
spew
out
repeated
bullshit
and
suppresses
your
thinking
in
the
long
term
it
doesn't
seem
worth
it
am
i
alone
on
this
wake
up
sheeple
i
want
to
be
dominated
by
a
hot
chick
like
i
want
her
to
force
me
to
go
down
on
her
and
smack
me
around
a
little
are
there
any
girls
out
there
down
for
that
kinda
shit
i
wrote
this
because
its
almost
summer
and
because
i'm
nostalgic
for
my
childhood
summers
and
because
when
i
think
of
my
future
i
like
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
with
you
in
it
i
think
one
of
the
most
romantic
and
simultaneously
sad
sounds
in
my
world
is
the
sound
of
chirping
crickets
crickets
that
chirp
around
dusk
when
the
air
is
still
warm
but
the
summer
sky
is
slowly
fading
into
shades
of
blue
and
purple
its
the
time
of
night
when
people
sit
on
their
porches
or
take
a
stroll
around
the
block
everybody
and
everything
is
at
peace
relaxing
and
i'd
like
to
think
that
that's
how
life
must
be
in
europe
or
something
its
a
romanticized
time
of
day
and
i
hold
on
to
that
sacred
hour
every
afternoon
like
i'm
never
going
to
experience
it
again
and
sometimes
i
think
wow
wouldn't
it
be
nice
to
experience
this
with
somebody
else
i'd
like
to
walk
barefoot
in
the
grass
with
somebody
hold
hands
and
talk
about
our
day
complain
about
work
and
make
plans
about
what
we're
cooking
tomorrow
when
we
recognize
the
lingering
scent
of
summer
bbq
from
a
neighbor
across
the
alley
and
we'd
pass
creeping
cats
and
auto
sprinklers
that
turn
on
when
the
glaring
sun
sets
and
when
we'd
tire
of
talking
we'd
welcome
the
silence
and
walk
home
our
home
and
listen
to
the
crickets
chirp
remember
those
posts
of
guys
thinking
it's
hard
to
get
a
blow
job
here
i
am
totally
down
especially
if
you
reciprocate
i'm
sure
there
are
more
straight
ladies
like
me
here
on
campus
or
you
can
just
find
me
i
know
admin
cronos
loves
older
women
but
has
he
ever
been
with
one
i
mean
dated
one
slept
with
one
etc
dating
a
girl
from
ut
we've
been
dating
for
three
years
now
since
freshman
yr
she
cheated
on
me
once
during
a
summer
internship
freshman
yr
basically
this
past
new
years
she
was
a
drunken
mess
hitting
on
every
guy
in
site
being
touchy
feely
while
i
was
basically
playing
babysitter
for
her
and
our
friends
however
since
freshman
yr
i
felt
weve
turned
the
corner
since
shes
a
devout
catholic
and
she
gave
me
her
virginity
which
is
very
special
to
her
we've
also
told
we
love
each
other
but
to
my
main
story
since
were
dating
long
distance
is
it
wrong
for
me
to
be
pissed
that
she
is
going
out
and
drinking
tues
thurs
sat
of
this
week
wont
see
her
at
all
over
spring
break
the
weekend
after
springbreak
she
is
going
to
round
up
which
is
a
crap
ton
of
frat
parties
the
reason
i'm
pissed
is
because
last
weekend
she
ran
a
5k
but
the
two
weekends
before
i
visited
austin
in
back
to
back
weekends
meanwhile
she
has
not
visited
me
since
jan
20th
is
it
ok
for
me
to
be
pissed
am
i
in
the
wrong
sorry
for
the
tldr

how
do
we
turn
off
your
commentary
no
one
asked
for
it
and
it
is
getting
old
you
are
just
supposed
to
post
the
stuff
if
you
want
to
comment
use
your
actual
facebook
am
i
the
only
one
who
doesn't
think
kate
upton
is
all
that
i
mean
sure
she's
pretty
but
i
don't
see
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
people
treat
her
like
she's
some
kind
of
goddess
i
even
saw
some
post
about
a
girl
saying
if
kate
upton
walks
past
her
boyfriend
and
he
doesn't
look
back
at
her
then
he's
gay
tf
maybe
your
boyfriend
just
has
the
courtesy
of
not
checking
another
girl
out
while
he's
with
you
whose
the

blue
in
her

were
at
a
party
and
she
was
there
and
she's
so
hot
and
her
boyfriend
my
roommate
left
early
and
well
alcohol's
a
bitch
and
no
i'm
not
blaming
it
on
alcohol
i
was
fully
conscious
of
my
decision
but
i
was
drunk
and
i
think
she
was
too
anyway
we
had
great
sex
and
after
we
both
promised
to
not
to
tell
anyone
about
what
happened
now
she
just
sent
me
text
don't
ask
me
how
she
got
my
number
telling
me
that
she
needs
to
tell
my
roommate
the
truth
something
about
feeling
too
guilty
and
how
she
can't
keep
pretending
around
him
i'm
trying
to
convince
her
not
to
or
at
least
to
wait
until
the
end
of
spring
semester
because
i'm
living
with
him
until
then
but
she
keeps
telling
me
that
the
truth
has
to
come
out
and
now
i'm
pretty
sure
her
stupid
ass
is
going
to
tell
him
i
can't
play
it
off
like
i
didn't
know
she
was
his
girlfriend
because
i
met
her
before
he's
the
one
that
introduced
us
i
can
maybe
play
it
off
that
i
was
blackout
drunk
and
that
i
had
no
clue
what
happened
that
night
but
it's
too
risky
i'll
save
that
as
a
last
resort
if
only
that
self
righteous
bitch
would
keep
her
mouth
shut
for
just
one
more
semester
i
guess
my
question
to
you
all
is
how
can
i
keep
this
situation
contained
what
can
i
do
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
or
if
push
comes
to
shove
what
should
i
tell
my
roommate
and
no
there's
no
way
in
hell
i'm
telling
him
the
truth
i
mean
like
excuses
for
what
happened
or
some
kind
of
scapegoat
any
help
would
be
appreciated
if
what
y'all
call
2
were
actually
the
majority
would
the
world
be
more
advanced
and
people
smarter
many
of
us
not
just
ags
but
american
college
students
in
general
are
very
passionate
and
dedicated
for
going
to
see
people
from
our
school
steal
an
oval
ball
from
people
from
another
school
and
take
it
to
the
other
side
showing
our
school's
colors
and
telling
people
where
we
study
putting
our
school
name
all
over
our
vehicles
clothing
bedrooms
living
rooms
doormats
wall
clocks
and
toilet
sear
covers
if
all
this
dedication
time
and
money
spent
in
being
aggies
or
longhorns
bearkats
meerkats
aadvarks
pandas
cheetahs
platypuses
etc
would
be
spent
in
research
studying
learning
stuff
relevant
to
our
career
going
on
actual
field
work
wouldn't
we
be
much
smarter
as
a
nation
i
know
alot
of
you
are
going
to
write
you
have
to
make
time
to
be
a
good
aggie
i'm
in
the
corp
and
i
keep
good
grades
etc
i
personally
don't
go
to
games
and
i
barely
have
time
to
sleep
i
also
work
however
and
pay
my
own
tuition
and
bills
that
is
beside
the
issue
the
point
is
that
this
very
extreme
passion
we
feel
for
being
an
aggie
would
be
nothing
if
it
wasn't
for
the
careers
we're
building
here
in
aggieland
i'm
not
saying
it's
wrong
to
be
proud
of
the
school
that
admitted
you
or
liking
sports
but
what
if
for
example
aggie
future
chemists
were
all
so
passionate
about
chemistry
that
they
would
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
in
a
season
lab
pass
every
semester
that
would
allow
you
to
take
a
special
workshop
every
saturday
where
you
get
to
do
individual
research
at
the
lab
or
future
geologists
can
go
on
trips
and
study
a
cave
or
a
fault
future
astronomers
could
go
saturday
night
planet
hunting
with
the
big
telescope
and
the
money
for
these
tickets
could
be
used
directly
to
improve
resources
and
equipment
maybe
it's
because
i'm
not
into
sports
but
wouldn't
it
be
cool
if
all
our
efforts
and
money
spent
on
watching
two
groups
fight
over
a
ball
would
be
spent
on
academic
activities
all
a
game
proves
is
that
some
people
can
run
throw
catch
and
kick
better
than
others
and
there's
a
luck
factor
to
every
game
too
even
the
best
runner
can
trip
the
best
catcher
can
fumble
etc
and
cause
the
whole
outcome
to
change
does
a
m
beating
harvard
or
mit
56
7
make
us
a
better
academic
institution
than
them
what
if
we
put
our
efforts
into
beating
the
hell
out
of
their
academics
instead
of
just
their
football
team
if
all
schools
in
the
u.s
were
full
of
students
like
those
that
are
called
2
ers
today
we
would
probably
have
flying
cars
and
renewable
energy
by
now
9953
all
of
my
friends
are
gleeks
maybe
i
just
don't
get
it
but
every
time
i
watch
glee
i
think
it
is
a
terrible
show
am
i
doing
something
wrong
are
there
two
glees
one
good
and
one
shitty
we
can't
be
talking
about
the
same
show

i'm
about
to
graduate
this
semester
yet
i
have
not
found
the
best
way
to
study
and
work
effectively
what
have
i
learned
in
college
then
6958
i
am
a
recent
alum
and
reading
these
posts
makes
me
nostalgic
for
the
my
time
at
cornell
when
i
was
blissfully
ignorant
of
how
hard
it
is
to
find
a
job
post
graduation
that
uses
my
skills
and
credentials
the
next
time
i
hear
whoa
you
went
to
cornell
then
what
are
you
doing
here
at
my
low
wage
temporary
job
i
think
i
will
burst
into
tears
or
punch
the
person
in
the
face
i
feel
like
i
am
the
only
guy
around
here
who
could
care
less
about
aggie
football
it
wouldn't
bother
me
a
bit
if
we
lost
every
single
game
i
came
here
for
an
education
yet
when
i
talk
to
people
about
my
school
they
always
want
to
talk
about
the
sec
and
football
what's
so
great
about
a
bunch
of
uneducated
meat
heads
smacking
in
to
each
other
is
it
healthy
to
alternate
nights
of
0
hours
of
sleep
and
14
hours
i
had
double
penetration
sex
last
night
but
i
didnt
feel
anything
at
all
is
that
normal
i'm
a
guy
why
do
black
girls
clap
their
hands
when
they're
arguing
with
someone
this
clap
is
clap
so
clap
annoying
drinko
de
mayo
aftermath
went
home
this
morning
and
my
mom
keeps
asking
me
what's
wrong
and
if
i'm
okay
does
she
not
understand
that
i
am
hungover
you
know
whats
bullshit
some
girls
practically
make
a
living
off
of
insulting
their
friends
about
anything
and
everything
but
then
they
get
butthurt
and
offended
if
you
say
anything
back
to
them
or
make
jokes
about
them
stop
being
jealous
bitches
damn
is
it
bad
that
i
want
to
drop
out
of
college
get
married
before
i
turn
20
and
be
an
air
force
wife
that's
all
i
really
want
out
of
life
college
ain't
for
me
im
a
ut
first
year
thinking
of
transferring
to
a
m
i
never
wanted
to
go
to
ut
it
was
always
a
backup
i
got
very
excited
the
summer
after
i
made
the
decision
to
attend
but
now
that
i've
been
here
am
extremely
disappointed
i
never
applied
to
a
m
though
for
the
sole
reason
that
i
was
scared
id
be
rejected
and
ostracized
if
i
lived
out
a
liberal
bisexual
female
who
could
say
her
religion
is
earth
im
not
in
your
face
about
any
of
this
stuff
though
im
chill
and
relaxedjust
tired
of
being
closeted
however
i
have
spent
two
weekends
in
aggielandonce
senior
year
and
once
this
year
both
times
with
my
boyfriend
long
time
bestfriend
the
first
time
i
visited
it
changed
75
of
my
opinions
about
the
school
the
second
time
i
visited
i
cried
on
the
way
back
to
austin
because
i
felt
so
at
home
at
a
m
and
i
long
to
be
in
the
aggie
familyto
feel
a
part
of
a
united
community
which
is
huge
exciting
honorable
i
am
considering
transferring
for
so
many
reasons
i
can
tell
you
in
a
pm
if
you
want
to
help
i
am
pretty
unhappy
at
ut
but
still
going
to
give
it
a
full
year
of
my
time
but
i
am
scared
to
leave
behind
the
most
selective
honors
program
at
ut
the
professors
the
music
scene
the
study
abroad
and
language
opportunities
and
the
free
spiritedness
i
am
scared
of
what
my
parents
will
think
who
are
putting
me
through
my
first
four
years
but
there
are
fundamental
things
lacking
here
that
a
m
has
i
want
it
so
badly
that
it
hurts
when
i
see
y'alls
comments
on
confessions
from
touring
highschoolers
those
give
me
hope
is
there
room
for
me
in
the
aggie
family
i've
become
so
drugged
up
on
anti
depressants
alcohol
and
recreational
drugs
that
i've
reached
a
point
where
apathy
is
my
only
state
of
mind
i
can
no
longer
find
excitement
and
joy
from
fun
activities
or
sadness
or
the
ability
to
care
for
my
failures
my
friends
don't
see
it
and
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
tell
them
at
that
what
could
they
do
i'm
20
i
have
no
friends
and
i
have
never
kissed
a
girl
i
am
attractive
do
well
in
school
and
have
interesting
hobbies
on
the
inside
i
am
dead
what
is
the
point
of
life
if
you
have
nobody
to
share
it
with
1375
ive
never
had
a
boyfriend
what
is
wrong
with
me
my
chem
102
si
leader
for
utley's
class
is
the
most
beautiful
man
on
this
planet
he
is
just
so
nerdy
in
the
most
attractive
way
i'm
always
too
busy
admiring
his
perfectly
scruffy
face
bedroom
voice
and
sexy
glasses
that
i
don't
actually
learn
chemistry
good
thing
i
already
know
chemistry
too
bad
he's
a
graduating
senior
and
i'm
only
a
freshman
but
a
girl
can
dream
right
seriously
can't
handle
this
i'm
a
minority
student
who
hates
being
that
guy
who's
singled
out
at
a
party
wtf
am
i
doing
wrong
why
can't
i
be
accepted
14924
i
love
you
but
you
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
so
we
couldn't
be
together
for
the
summer
i
was
at
the
club
and
i
met
someone
who
i've
hooked
up
with
a
few
times
could
you
ever
forgive
me
if
you
knew
360
i
try
to
convert
people
to
christianity
at
wednesday
convo
is
this
seat
saved
no
are
you
flirt
convert
why
did
beyonce
say
to
the
left
to
the
left
9938
guys
why
after
hooking
up
at
a
party
and
being
super
nice
to
a
girl
do
you
ignore
her
when
she
messages
you
the
next
day
this
has
happened
to
so
many
girls
i
know
and
they
are
not
unattractive
and
i'm
not
just
saying
that
because
i
know
them
why
do
you
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
girl
after
making
out
at
a
party
isn't
it
a
good
thing
if
she
shows
interest
67
why
are
all
these
half
asian
girls
so
goodamn
attractive
y'all
do
it
to
me
every
time
is
it
weird
that
as
a
girl
i
don't
like
hearing
guys
blurt
out
you're
gorgeous
and
whatnot
when
i
am
on
northgate
i
mean
guys
that
i
don't
know
at
all
they're
just
drunk
guys
trying
to
spit
game
and
get
it
in
for
the
night
so
the
compliment
is
invalid
18397
my
mom
and
dad
tell
me
how
much
they
hate
each
other
all
the
time
already
divorced
and
also
six
thousand
miles
away
but
still
have
to
wechat
me
all
the
sh
t
i
wish
i
could
just
leave
them
forever
i'm
busy
enough
studying
and
going
thru
recruitment
aren't
parents
supposed
to
support
you
all
they
do
is
depressing
me
if
a
girl
says
just
the
tip
and
you
go
all
in
is
it
considered
rape
i
drink
every
weekend
and
have
a
great
time
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
wanna
know
the
difference
between
liberals
and
conservatives
detroit
has
been
ran
by
liberals
for
the
past
50
years
look
at
where
that
city
is
bankrupt
texas
has
been
ran
by
conservatives
for
50
years
look
at
where
we
are
economically
that
is
all
admin
edit
i'm
only
posting
this
now
because
i
can't
come
back
and
say
this
at
the
time
this
comment
actually
goes
live
for
the
last
damned
time
get
it
through
your
heads
that
a
city
has
completely
different
economic
merits
than
state
a
city
does
not
have
the
vast
resources
population
diverse
production
sectors
or
even
geographic
advantages
that
an
entire
state
may
have
you
have
a
city
on
one
hand
and
a
state
on
the
other
this
is
like
saying
apples
and
cats
are
the
same
thing
so
surely
since
an
apple
is
red
that
is
why
it
cannot
lick
it's
own
ass
like
a
cat

i
am
in
a
class
right
now
where
the
teacher
doesn't
call
on
women
as
much
as
men
and
when
women
do
get
to
talk
he's
way
more
likely
to
respond
to
their
comments
negatively
this
institutionalized
sexism
fucking
sucks
guys
what
do
i
do
all
i
want
is
a
guy
i
can
watch
supernatural
with
is
that
so
hard
to
find
so
i'm
assuming
having
prefrosh
and
a
roommate
in
the
room
means
no
masturbation
tonight
after
i
masturbate
my
butt
crack
gets
really
sweaty
and
starts
to
stink
i
am
a
virgin
and
i
do
not
want
my
first
sexual
partner
to
be
a
one
time
deal
because
my
ass
hole
smells
after
i
finish
should
i
shave
my
butt
crack
change
my
diet
get
off
my
birth
control
go
on
an
adventure
to
find
glory
and
riches
and
along
the
way
meet
some
strange
fantasy
creatures
who
help
me
realize
that
the
greatest
treasure
in
life
is
friendship
i
am
open
to
all
suggestions
5669

with

find
more
friends

i
major
in
biology
throughout
my
college
career
i
always
feel
that
i'm
doing
the
wrong
major
yet
i've
refused
to
change
it
because
i
keep
thinking
that
the
upcoming
courses
are
going
to
be
much
better
then
they
fail
my
expectations
every
single
time
now
it's
too
late
to
change
my
major
the
problem
is
i
like
every
subject
there
is
out
there
but
i
only
want
to
investigate
them
at
the
surface
and
not
delve
deep
into
anything
is
there
a
major
for
a
person
like
me

come
on
guys
we're
smarter
than
this
let's
drop
the
hate
and
get
down
to
what
really
matters

i
think
it's
time
to
break
up
with
my
girlfriend
i
love
her
so
much
but
i
can't
take
anymore
of
her
selfish
attitude
how
can
we
make
this
relationship
work
if
she
runs
away
whenever
we
argue
i'm
really
surprised
at
how
long
my
patience
has
lasted
i'm
so
glad
she
gained
so
much
weight
over
the
last
semester
it
will
make
the
breakup
much
easier
for
me
i
met
this
really
awesome
guy
who
just
so
happens
to
be
in
the
corps
over
the
weekend
i
have
always
wanted
to
date
a
cadet
but
i
can't
tell
if
he
is
into
me
or
just
wants
sex
i
haven't
been
on
the
dating
scene
in
awhile
so
i
don't
know
what
to
do
what's
your
secret

ok
so
i
bought
my
sports
pass
at
my
nsc
but
i
didn't
actually
go
pick
my
card
up
i
didn't
even
know
there
was
a
card
i
knew
i
wasn't
going
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
first
two
games
so
i
didn't
go
pick
it
up
once
someone
told
me
there
was
a
card.today
i
saw
on
the
website
that
there
was
a
time
period
where
you
could
go
pick
it
up
and
it
ended
in
august
so
does
this
mean
i'm
screwed
because
i
thought
that
i
didn't
even
know
there
was
a
card
i
thought
it
was
done
through
your
student
id
help
i
really
want
to
go
the
the
rest
of
the
games
and
i
paid
for
it
already
during
the
past
year
have
you
consumed
alcohol
i.e
had
more
than
a
few
sips
of
beer
wine
or
liquor
guessing
the
alcohol
edu
creator
was
not
a
badger
are
you
a
big
fan
of

or
do
you
hate
this

with

come

to
the
girl
i
saw
today
on
the
arts
quad
around
11am
wearing
your
yellow
chiffon
high
low
skirt
denim
jacket
and
white
shirt
you
are
absolutely
beautiful
you
passed
crossed
me
as
i
was
walking
to
get
into
gws
and
then
an
hour
later
by
rockefeller
hall
and
just
though
you
were
so
classy
and
stunning
you
looked
a
little
down
maybe
because
it
was
a
little
chilly
and
you
were
rethinking
your
decision
to
wear
that
skirt
maybe
you
were
having
a
bad
day
but
your
beauty
did
not
go
unnoticed
twerking
grinding
what
the
fuck
ever
happened
to
waltzing
keep
it
classy

when
you
find
your
ex
on
a
gay
hookup
site
a
couple
months
after
he
broke
up
with
you
you
know
it
was
for
the
best
why
can't
gays
here
be
anything
but
sluts
does
anyone
who
identifies
as
lgbt
find
the
phrase
bats
for
the
other
team
offensive
i
snapchat
do
you
either
way
give
your
like
to
nyu
snaps
a
burgeoning
page
meant
to
visually
connect
students
at
nyu
your
snapchats
are
posted
anonymously
unless
you
want
to
share
with
the
world
and
all
in
all
it
seems
like
a
great
way
to
have
fun
i
am
not
the
admin
of
nyu
snaps
i
feel
like
i
should
say
that
check
it
out
so
guys
were
there
any
oscars
you
felt
went
to
the
wrong
people
this
year
if
i
wanted
to
try
and
join
bonfire
what
do
i
need
to
do
and
who
do
i
talk

i
think
it's
funny
how
a
lot
of
girls
complain
that
guys
are
all
shallow
and
only
care
about
looks
but
as
soon
as
they
see
a
really
good
looking
guy
with
an
average
looking
girl
they
immediately
try
to
tear
her
down
saying
things
like
oh
my
god
she's
not
even
pretty
and
don't
even
bother
to
wonder
if
she
is
kind
or
smart
or
if
she
possesses
any
other
admirable
qualities
other
than
physical
beauty
not
all
girls
are
like
this
but
i've
met
way
too
many
who
are
why
do
you
expect
guys
to
value
qualities
other
than
looks
if
you
personally
don't
maybe
guys
aren't
as
shallow
as
you
think
maybe
you're
just
lacking
a
good
personality
again
this
doesn't
apply
to
all
girls
but
just
many
that
i
have
met
do
you
know
why
you
can
never
find
waldo
and
carmen
san
diego
because
they
live
in
a
country
where
they
aren't
being
watched
all
the
time
thanks
obama
can
we
stick
to
one
confessions
page
i'm
embarrassed
when
i
wear
polo
shirts
at
brown
i'm
a
woman
i'm
not
douchey
i
just
like
preppy
clothes
why
the
judgment
this
school
year
i
have
made
so
many
friends
but
i've
also
lost
many
friends
i've
done
so
many
things
that
i
never
imagined
myself
doing
in
the
beginning
i
was
so
sure
of
who
i
was
and
what
i
stood
for
but
now
i
am
confused
i
don't
feel
any
sense
of
regret
or
guilt
because
i
tell
myself
that
acting
the
way
i
do
is
purely
experimental
and
pretty
much
just
a
game
there
is
plently
of
time
to
grow
up
but
when
do
we
actually
grow
up
am
i
becoming
the
person
that
i
pretend
to
be
the
person
who
hurts
others
without
any
remorse
what
should
i
do
did
anyone
else
not
pray
at
muster
2957
i
have
seen
this
guy
twice
on
lau
2
but
i
dont
know
if
he's
looking
at
me
or
just
looking
around
we
made
eye
contact
i
think
and
you
smiled
so
it
made
my
night
but
i'm
not
sure
if
it
is
just
chance
you
first
wore
a
purple
shirt
and
tonight
a
reddish
shirt
what
is
your
name
because
you
are
really
cute
1691
so
many
people
in
the
nyu
subreddit
are
really
rude
every
time
i
ask
a
genuine
question
or
try
to
spark
a
discussion
many
replies
that
i
receive
are
dripping
with
sarcasm
and
elitism
they
all
act
so
inviting
on
the
facebook
group
but
i
feel
as
though
the
subreddit
itself
is
so
hateful
because
there's
more
of
a
level
of
anonymity
than
in
the
group
i
wish
we
could
all
just
fucking
get
along
and
talk
to
each
other
like
a
bunch
of
civil
human
beings
instead
of
being
afraid
to
say
anything
i
wish
that
i
could
bake
a
cake
out
of
rainbows
and
smiles
and
we
could
all
eat
it
and
be
happy
aren't
we
peers
can't
i
just
talk
to
you
guys
without
feeling
like
i'm
being
attacked
5660
why
is
everyone
so
concerned
with
finding
someone
of
a
particular
race
why
don't
people
just
want
to
be
with
an
amazing
person
no
matter
their
race
if
race
is
a
priority
in
your
significant
other
then
you
are
allowing
yourself
to
miss
out
on
some
truly
magnificent
people
i'm
a
girl
on
this
page
who
wouldn't
be
creeped
out
if
a
guy
thought
i
was
cute
and
messaged
me
its
flattering
as
long
as
they
don't
say
something
creeps
like
you're
hot
lets
bang
or
i've
been
seeing
you
on
campus
and
at
your
place
and
at
heb
and
i
think
you're
cute
but
would
the
guys
of
this
page
be
creeped
out
if
a
girl
messaged
them
saying
hey
cause
they
think
they're
funny
and
or
cute
am
i
an
evil
vicious
person
because
i
am
so
weak
that
drugs
have
become
more
vital
than
water
for
me
to
the
point
that
when
i
moved
into
a
room
my
best
friend
2
previous
roommates
had
available
that
i
know
i
have
casted
a
presence
in
which
drug
use
is
so
acceptable
by
mere
justification
i
had
to
bring
drugs
with
me
because
i
have
become
so
socially
dependent
on
them
the
thought
of
meeting
their
other
3
roommates
and
getting
people
to
like
me
was
so
terrifying
well
i
shared
some
with
my
best
friend
when
we
went
out
on
the
first
night
and
after
becoming
intoxicated
i
mentioned
i
had
them
to
one
other
roommate
out
with
us
whom
i
just
met
he
was
down
to
do
them
i
believe
it
was
his
4
time
with
this
particular
substance
ever
and
he
had
never
purchased
it
well
it
was
no
secret
i
was
a
daily
user
but
what
kills
me
is
he
went
from
4
total
to
3rd
time
this
week
and
he
purchased
them
from
my
personal
he
asked
for
more
tonight
and
i
told
him
i
was
out
it
is
barely
thursday
my
influence
had
him
and
a
couple
other
roommates
following
my
unintentional
influence
an
occasional
weekend
is
one
thing
damn
even
every
weekend
isn't
that
bad
but
tuesday
wed
and
thurs
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
use
for
no
reason
at
all
and
they
were
so
quick
because
i
have
given
them
an
impression
that
it
is
the
cool
thing
to
do
i
see
it
when
they
ask
me
questions
or
they
help
me
find
something
or
i
tell
them
a
story
they
don't
see
it
for
how
pathetic
it
is
they
see
it
as
if
i'm
some
sort
of
big
shot
because
i
will
offer
their
friends
more
and
more
money
for
their
scripts
until
they
can't
say
no
because
my
tolerance
is
so
high
for
everything
that
i
take
that
it's
almost
at
a
point
they
can
brag
to
people
about
it
like
if
they
were
bragging
that
i
was
the
best
at
a
certain
skill
or
sport
this
isn't
the
life
i
chose
this
isn't
how
i
wanted
things
to
be
for
me
i
want
to
spend
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
dollars
on
things
i
can
show
for
myself
or
to
better
someone
this
life
is
not
cool
if
i
could
take
it
all
back
i
would
never
have
tried
one
thing
ever
you
will
never
realize
how
quickly
and
strong
it
takes
over
and
things
will
never
be
the
same
i
was
blessed
with
a
life
that
i
can
only
describe
as
privileged
i
had
everything
and
more
i
had
the
amazing
car
best
phone
best
laptop
an
amazing
girl
i
would
travel
the
country
yearly
i
was
in
the
best
school
in
the
world
and
i
could
spend
money
on
anything
i
desired
i
never
knew
how
it
felt
to
be
broke
and
hungry
it
all
started
one
week
day
when
my
ex
roommate
made
me
feel
that
it
was
cool
to
take
pills
for
no
reason
and
to
find
joy
in
them
my
use
is
apparent
there
is
no
changing
that
whether
they
think
i
have
a
problem
or
if
i
do
it
for
fun
they
are
aware
it
is
a
daily
constant
thing
so
i
can't
hide
it
from
them
but
i
just
don't
want
them
to
use
my
actions
as
justification
or
as
a
gateway
do
you
think
i
am
horrible
so
if
you
think
god
made
all
living
things
in
the
garden
of
eden
as
vegetarians
why
do
you
eat
meat
1001
yay
i
got
the
1000th
confession
1002
wow
i
can't
believe
that
this
is
the
1000th
confession
1003
my
confession
is
that
i
don't
actually
have
a
confession
i
just
want
to
be
confession
1000
1004
i
want
to
be
the
100th
confession
1005
i
wanna
be
1000
1006
i
want
to
be
1000
live
laf
love
1007
real
confession
i
only
wrote
this
in
hopes
that
it
will
be
confession
1000
really
guys
really
what
should
you
do
if
your
bike
was
stolen
sometime
last
week
13777
as
a
woman
i
still
don't
understand
these
complaints
of
discrimination
and
the
like
women
are
paid
less
really
for
the
same
job
women
are
sexualized
in
what
realm
porn
television
shows
don't
women
actively
participate
in
their
own
sexualization
ermagerd
slut
shaming
guise
men
are
often
shamed
for
having
multiple
partners
by
women
and
to
some
extent
other
men
i
can
think
of
only
one
current
issue
that
affects
women
more
so
than
men
and
needs
immediate
attention
rape
i
was
tempted
to
lump
that
together
with
other
violent
crimes
but
apparently
since
women
are
usually
the
victims
it
is
in
its
own
category
all
that
said
i
think
feminism
has
its
uses
just
don't
pretend
you're
oppressed
women
dwelling
in
countries
where
women
are
treated
as
dogs
would
be
insulted
also
if
someone
could
comment
on
what
i've
put
in
quotes
that'd
be
great
i
just
want
a
better
understanding
of
these
issues
9126
i've
got
a
proposal
it's
not
really
a
confession
but
please
post
it
anyway
and
hear
me
out
maybe
some
good
can
come
of
this
i've
noticed
that
a
ton
of
recent
confessions
pretty
much
the
most
recent
100
200
have
been
something
along
the
lines
of
i
wish
i
could
meet
more
guys
girls
the
whole
p
b
saga
while
heartwarming
and
straight
out
of
a
romantic
comedy
has
left
the
rest
of
us
feeling
a
bit
left
out
for
the
girls
where
are
the
guys
who
notice
and
the
guts
to
speak
up
for
the
guys
where
are
the
girls
who
don't
brush
us
off
we
are
all
posting
vague
one
line
confessions
hoping
that
something
or
rather
someone
materializes
we
are
grasping
blindly
at
nothing
hoping
to
find
another
hand
my
idea
comes
from
confession
9095
it
seems
like
many
people
guys
and
girls
are
a
bit
frustrated
with
the
traditional
social
setting
for
meeting
people
of
the
opposite
gender
and
wish
they
could
do
things
the
old
way
asking
someone
to
go
to
coffee
hike
whatever
with
you
can
be
nerve
wracking
they
could
be
in
a
relationship
already
they
could
not
be
interested
or
they
could
just
be
a
jerk
the
benefits
however
high
seem
to
be
outweighed
by
the
risks
can
you
the
admin
s
pick
a
time
and
place
for
a
convergence
of
everyone
who
agrees
with
9095
and
9106
by
extension
to
meet
and
greet
it
would
be
really
great
to
be
able
to
mingle
with
a
crowd
of
people
who
i
can
be
sure
aren't
going
to
just
toss
me
away
like
yesterday's
paper
i
don't
think
you'd
have
to
do
any
actual
coordinating
work
other
than
post
the
time
and
place
maybe
make
an
event
on
facebook
some
saturday
afternoon
a
week
or
two
from
now
when
the
weather
is
nice
maybe
comments
if
this
is
a
good
idea
like
this
or
comment
those
of
us
who've
decided
that
we
don't
like
the
party
scene
have
pretty
much
been
thrown
overboard
life's
a
challenge
why
go
it
alone
question
for
the
admins
do
y'all
like
going
down
on
girls
571
sometimes
i
look
at
my
moncler
and
think
to
myself
dammit
why
is
this
not
a
barbour
lol
at
the
girl
and
guy
that
got
mips
for
drinking
in
your
car
at
harry's
how
did
you
two
get
into
a
m
in
the
first
place
how
do
i
come
out
to
my
roommate
and
friends
i
feel
like
it's
right
to
let
them
know
most
of
them
seem
like
they'd
be
fine
with
it
some
not
has
anyone
else
been
in
this
situation
and
what
was
your
experience
i'm
a
guy

why
does
the
guy
side
in
swq
always
smell
disgusting
like
gym
socks
gosh
my
mind
doesn't
understand
why
someone
would
make
it
their
goal
to
ruin
someone
else's
relationship
like
bitch
don't
you
have
a
life
i
guess
not
that's
why
you
have
to
go
around
ruining
other
people's
life
and
fucking
throwing
yourself
at
every
guy
in
a
relationship
even
if
they
push
you
away
i
just
don't
get
it
does
it
even
occur
to
people
that
google
is
pretty
much
like
a
private
more
colorful
version
of
the
nsa
the
amount
of
data
they
collect
on
us
is
ridiculous
and
amazon's
plans
for
a
drone
army
skynet
is
coming
friends
that's
skynet
spelled
with
colorful
blue
yellow
red
and
green
letters
there's
a
difference
professor
lang
what
are
you
even
saying
right
now
something
about
lemons
been
reading
this
page
for
a
couple
of
months
freshman
really
enjoying
gig
em
week
and
bonfire
parties
but
i'm
curious
is
brewmaster
a
real
person
or
just
a
made
up
dood
for
comedy
4866
i
don't
understand
why
many
times
i
go
into
a
bathroom
and
the
toilet
isn't
flushed
this
happens
to
me
in
places
all
over
campus
how
do
you
not
flush
i
don't
want
to
see
your
piss
or
your
bloody
period
for
that
matter
gross
16140
i
could
be
imagining
things
but
today
i
think
you
stopped
in
front
of
the
ctown
eng
quad
bridge
especially
to
say
hi
to
me
we
barely
know
each
other
but
i
really
hope
we
get
to
even
if
you're
a
senior
seeing
your
smile
makes
my
day
who
knows
maybe
we
could
be
something
18577
i
don't
even
know
you
but
i
know
that
i
reaaaally
want
to
get
to
know
you
so
i've
been
spending
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
in
the
building
where
you
usually
are
even
though
honestly
i
have
no
real
reason
to
be
there
it
has
approximately
0
things
to
do
with
my
major
but
you
seem
cool
and
i
caught
you
looking
a
couple
times
so
i
know
you're
curious
to
say
the
least
hopefully
one
of
us
will
step
it
up
and
talk
to
the
other
this
week
i'm
going
to
be
a
freshman
at
cc
next
year
and
i'm
genuinely
concerned
that
there
isn't
a
party
scene
i
mean
i'm
all
about
that
work
hard
play
hard
attitude
are
cc
students
down
to
have
some
fun
as
well
as
get
their
intense
studying
done
have
a
secret
share
it
on
the
whisper
app
https
bitly.com
19ldu1e
i
read
your
guys
post
and
realize
that
all
you
guys
really
want
is
a
good
cat
got
a
horrible
boyfriend
fuck
that
cat
ladies
don't
have
that
problem
get
a
cat
ladies
any
gentlemen
with
lady
issues
should
also
get
a
cat
feeling
sad
put
mittens
on
it
feeling
happy
cat
don't
care
go
hang
out
with
your
friends
guys
lets
just
get
cats
2639
i
don't
get
why
most
people
at
nyu
all
of
them
it
seems
completely
reject
the
idea
of
god
if
you
are
so
smart
why
can't
you
at
least
acknowledge
that
there's
a
possibility
that
an
all
powerful
entity
could
exist
and
before
anyone
retorts
with
how
could
a
god
exist
look
at
how
terrible
the
earth
is
to
a
person
of
any
faith
this
place
isn't
our
final
destination
why
would
it
be
perfect
i'm
an
orthodox
sufi
muslim
and
my
goal
is
eternal
peace
13024
shout
out
to
the
big
red
storage
guys
for
being
so
freaking
dreamy
forgive
me
for
looking
like
a
hot
mess
please
love
me
874
am
i
the
only
girl
that
thought
the
beta
party
was
a
total
bust
hope
you
guys
felt
cool
spending
all
your
money
on
a
tent
and
a
waterfall
that
me
and
my
friends
only
used
to
put
out
our
cigarettes
fratlandia
my
ass
that
shit
was
a
total
clamfest
ok
i
have
a
major
complaint
about
this
and
feel
like
a
lot
of
people
feel
the
same
if
you
sit
in
the
same
seat
all
semester
for
a
whole
semester
then
that
is
your
spot
not
to
be
taken
by
someone
who
only
shows
up
on
tests
and
3
other
random
days
of
the
year
you
sit
in
that
seat
every
freaking
day
and
if
they
showed
up
ever
then
they
would
know
that
i
suggest
that
the
university
institute
a
rule
that
you
can
kick
someone
out
of
your
seat
if
you
can
prove
that
you
have
constantly
made
it
your
spot
who
else
agrees
with
this
i'm
really
into
pinterest
but
i'm
a
guy
and
i'm
straight
is
that
normal
13509
is
it
weird
for
a
girl
to
approach
a
guy
at
a
bar
not
for
the
sole
purpose
of
having
him
buy
me
a
drink
but
what
if
he's
mind
blowingly
hot
and
i
want
to
meet
him
how
does
one
get
a
boyfriend
without
randomly
hooking
up
first
8399
i
am
white
and
whenever
i
rap
along
with
the
music
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
am
allowed
to
say
the
n
word
i
know
it's
not
accepted
to
say
it
in
general
but
am
i
allowed
to
when
i'm
rapping
oh
p.s
i
wouldn't
make
a
big
deal
out
of
it
if
you
were
to
call
me
cracker
i'd
laugh
at
you
stop
being
hypocrites
4549
this
page
is
really
something
it's
nice
to
know
people
share
some
of
my
problems
or
have
it
worse
than
i
do
i
say
in
honor
of
cornell
confessions
we
have
a
big
meet
up
and
celebrate
like
this
post
if
you're
interested
in
having
a
rager
this
break
because
im
fucking
staying
here
in
ithaca
to
all
those
who
are
lonely
lets
fucking
meet
i
want
to
be
your
friend
bar
meet
up
ctown
meet
up
who's
down
6317
who
are
those
two
black
guys
that
work
at
yates
that
are
always
together
one
is
over
6ft
with
a
beard
and
the
other
is
slightly
under
6ft
with
good
hair
if
you
know
who
im
talking
about
can
you
let
me
know
who
they
are
what
do
you
all
think
about
them
15875
i'm
naturally
attracted
to
women
that
are
older
than
me
problem
is
i'm
a
senior
this
year
so
the
only
people
that
catch
my
eye
now
are
ph.d
students
how
am
i
suppose
to
spit
some
game
to
someone
who
is
most
likely
going
to
be
my
ta
not
to
mention
i
can't
take
you
out
to
dinner
and
have
a
good
time
and
then
see
you
in
office
hours
the
next
day
how
awkward
would
that
be
damnit
11632
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
at
cornell
about
the
unfair
advantages
that
big
financial
companies
and
law
firms
have
in
recruiting
the
top
students
at
our
so
called
elite
university
but
this
is
just
flat
out
wrong
imagine
the
titanic
occurred
today
as
soon
as
it
hit
the
iceberg
word
goes
out
around
the
world
of
what
has
happened
but
no
body
yet
knows
what
the
end
result
is
are
you
going
to
congratulate
someone
who
at
that
moment
buys
a
ticket
for
the
titanic's
return
trip
from
london
to
new
york
no
you're
going
to
tell
them
that
they're
an
idiot
anyone
who
doesn't
realize
that
our
entire
financial
structure
is
fundamentally
broken
and
that
it
is
either
going
to
collapse
or
be
completely
gutted
is
just
as
idiotic
so
yes
it
is
wrong
that
cornell
pushes
so
many
of
it's
students
towards
these
prestigious
jobs
but
if
these
kids
want
to
go
then
fuck
it
i
don't
give
a
shit
anyone
so
oblivious
to
the
world
around
them
isn't
going
to
be
much
help
in
any
other
field
because
they're
too
fucking
self
absorbed
and
blinded
to
be
productive
in
any
meaningful
way
just
to
be
clear
every
one
of
you
that
is
planning
on
going
to
work
for
some
big
shot
law
or
financial
firm
you
are
an
idiot
to
the
rest
of
the
students
here
yeah
it
sucks
that
cornell
values
idiots
that
make
a
lot
of
money
over
everyone
else
and
it's
annoying
whenever
cornell
tries
to
make
me
follow
in
their
path
but
take
solace
in
the
fact
that
all
of
these
idiots
are
going
to
be
much
worse
off
in
20
years
from
now
then
you
they'll
have
no
jobs
no
money
and
everyone
in
our
society
will
hate
them
so
how
about
we
get
a
head
start
and
start
treating
these
people
like
what
they
are
idiots
8021
i
just
wasted
an
hour
looking
at
this
page

i

on
me
like
a
stack
of
bricks
that
i'm
going
to
be
homeless
in
nyc
this
summer
i
can't
go
home
and
i
don't
have
the
money
for
summer
housing
at
all
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
to
make
plans
of
survival
coles
gym
locker
and
bobst
ll
shit

i'm
panicking
so
badly
right
now
ags
where
is
a
good
place
to
get
your
aggie
ring
cleaned
for
cheap
free
so
pretty
much
every

go
to
find
respectable
single
fellas
help
a
girl
out
y'all

really
want
to
date

this
robot
project
i
wish
i
could
connect

other
skin
pickers
out
there
maybe
the
pcs
could
put
something
together
for
those
with
dermatillomania
and
trichotillomania
but
prefably
after
winter
break
because
clearly
all
of
us
are
too
stressed
out
with
finals
and
gouging
holes
in
our
faces
right
now
thank
you
13385
all
i
want
is
a
gay
german
boyfriend
is
that
too
much
to
ask
where
all
my
rangeland
majors
at
all
5
of
us
haha
god
damn
it
god
fucking
damn
it
why
are
you
starting
this
again
please
don't
infiltrate
my
support
system
isolate
me
destroy
my
relationships
and
drive
me
into
therapy
a
third
time
you
left
me
a
year
ago
why
do
you
feel
the
need
to
keep
me
isolated
and
hurt
i've
set
limits
and
set
limits
and
set
limits
but
clearly
you'll
never
respect
them
like
you
never
respected
me
i'm
talking
to
tara
next
week
i
need
this
to
end
1666
where
all
the
pokemon
fans
at
66
i
have
a
friend
who
is
obviously
gay
but
doesn't
know
it
yet
what
should
i
do
i
am
a
freshman
here
and
moved
in
almost
two
weeks
ago
knowing
nobody
down
here
i
live
with
a
random
roommate
off
campus
who
is
pretty
cool
but
is
always
out
with
his
own
friends
i
talk
to
people
in
class
on
the
bus
but
am
terrified
i'm
gonna
spend
this
semester
alone
without
clicking
with
a
group
of
friends
i'm
kinda
outgoing
and
not
a
loner
but
going
to
midnight
yell
or
northgate
alone
would
be
awkward
i
love
to
party
but
have
no
idea
how
to
find
them
or
who
to
go
with
where
do
i
start
who's
the
adorable
hispanic
girl
dressed
as
wednesday
in
the
library
238
so
you
guys
remember
the
power
outage
right
of
course
you
do
we
panicked
over
that
shit
well
most
of
us
anyway
while
you
were
all
out
doing
your
crazy
shit
outside
my
roommate
and
i
decided
to
adventure
to
other
dorms
and
see
what
we
could
find
out
we
went
into
peppers
and
saw
a
room
completely
open
i
shit
you
not
first
drawer
we
looked
through
we
saw
a
dildo
i
got
a
lot
of
toilet
paper
from
the
bathroom
so
i
didnt
get
any
of
this
dudes
shit
on
me
and
then
we
just
threw
it
out
so
if
you
thought
you
misplaced
your
dildo
you
did
not
and
we
know
your
secret
me
and
my
boyfriend
haven't
been
together
for
even
a
month
and
i
might
be
pregnant
what
should
we
do
i
am
a
woman
who
knows
what
she
wants
why
does
this
frighten
and
intimidate
i
don't
understand
especially
dealing
with
men
too
the
super
tall
guy
living
in
chapin
house
i've
seen
you
around
a
few
times
and
everytime
i
get
the
urge
have
gorilla
sex
with
you
all
night
long
maybe
we
can
make
that
happen
am
i
the
only
person
who
makes
their
sexual
partner
wear
socks
while
having
sex
one
day
i
named
a
file
on
my
computer
barrack
obama
the
i
moved
the
file
to
my
recycling
bin
then
when
i
went
to
empty
it
my
computer
asked
are
you
sure
you
want
to
permanently
delete
barrack
obama
i
had
an
awesome
feeling
clicking
the
yes
button
where
are
all
the
hot
gay
guys
apparently
not
at
rice
this
might
sound
racist
but
i
dont
think
i
am
just
that
people
i
hate
happened
to
be
black
like
those
girls
who
laugh
out
of
nowhere
in
the
hallway
getting
loud
and
shit
the
fuck
calm
yo
shit
trying
to
get
attention
and
always
with
i
am
shit
attitude
you
aint
shit
something
about
their
tone
and
attitude
just
brings
down
their
values
i
have
for
them
where
is
the
block
2
monthly
rag
pooping
on
this
campus
has
gotten
so
dull
i
confess
i
love
weathermen
where
are
my
meteorology
boys
at
13590
i
hate
how
people
at
cornell
are
so
over
sensitive
about
everything
i'm
a
pre
frosh
and
i'm
worried
that
everything
i
say
will
offend
someone
because
i
don't
believe
in
things
like
feminism
protecting
the
environment
affirmative
action
or
financial
aid
will
people
at
cornell
respect
my
views
too
back
to
that
death
penalty
confession
room
that
was
essentially
a
giant
blocked
in
treadmill
made
of
sandpaper
i
see
people
all
the
time
on
this
page
saying
rapists
need
the
death
penalty
most
people
who
say
this
when
you
talk
to
them
1
on
1
say
that
the
death
penalty
in
general
is
bad
contradictory
logic
anyways
the
best
way
to
do
the
death
penalty
would
be
hire
a
serial
killer
already
on
death
row
to
carry
out
another's
execution
in
a
normal
way
such
as
hanging
that
way
normal
people
guards
don't
get
ptsd
or
whatever
in
return
the
killer
gets
a
1
week
stay
on
his
execution
great
plan
amirite
why
is
everyone
complaining
about
leo
not
getting
an
oscar
when
harrison
ford
also
doesn't
have
one
i
moved
in
with
my
best
friend
and
we
had
a
huge
falling
out
not
too
long
after
i
found
out
she
was
going
behind
my
back
and
used
both
my
parents
and
me
we
no
longer
talk
and
keep
our
distance
as
best
as
we
can
my
main
issue
is
this
and
i'd
like
y'alls
thoughts
every
time
she
goes
in
her
room
or
leaves
the

she
always
locks
her
bedroom
door
i
didn't
do
anything
to
lose
her
trust
or
make
her
feel
as
though
i
would
ever
steal
from
her
as
i
stated
before
she
was
the
one
who
caused
our
friendship
to
be
over
would
y'all
be
offended
too
or
am
i
just
being
overly
sensitive
honest
question
from
a
gay
guy
do
girls
like
big
dicks
i
feel
like
the
only
people
who
truly
appreciate
a
large
male
member
are
other
guys
hooked
up
with
a
hung
guy
a
while
back
only
to
find
out
afterwards
that
he
had
a
girlfriend
i'm
unsure
if
his
girlfriend
really
appreciates
what
he
has
between
his
legs
i
could
bearly
handle
it
so
it
makes
me
question
does
she
does
she
even
like
it
what
all
can
she
do
with
it
just
wondering
ladies
take
it
away

my
favorite

was
when

was

to
be
a

how
considerate

next

can
you
do
something

no

gusta
that

rican
girl
famous
for
the
booty
last
year
she's
back
i've
been
thinking
about
going
to
the
west
campus
library
because
i
hear
the
women
there
are
very
attractive
i'm
not
a
ladies
man
by
any
means
although
honestly
i
am
an
attractive
guy
do
yall
think
i
might
be
able
to
get
a
number
or
two
there
or
would
that
be
a
waste
of
time
note
i've
never
tried
approaching
girls
studying
before
dunno
if
it's
a
good
idea
or
not
madison

http

watch
v
z_utxg9yage
so
i've
been
talking
to
this
guy
for
a
couple
months
now
and
i
kind
of
want
to
ask
him
out
for
valentines
but
last
time
he
said
anything
he
was
just
looking
for
a
friendship
and
i
assume
not
a
boyfriend
should
i
ask
or
will
that
just
mess
things
up
so
i
am
reading
a
lot
of
stuff
here
about
rape
culture
and
the
evils
of
men
i
am
a
man
and
i
have
never
raped
but
really
women
need
to
take
responsibility
for
this
as
well
if
a
girl
is
drunk
and
sleeps
with
someone
doesn't
say
no
then
all
the
sudden
the
man
is
viably
guilty
of
rape
because
for
some
reason
the
fact
that
she's
drunk
incapacitates
her
ability
to
refuse
however
if
a
man
gets
drunk
doesn't
say
no
then
nobody
stops
to
think
that
the
woman
is
viably
guilty
of
rape
in
fact
should
he
claim
rape
all
he'll
open
himself
up
to
is
mockery
so
all
the
sudden
we
men
have
to
be
more
responsible
about
not
raping
you
than
you
have
to
be
about
avoiding
situations
where
you
can
get
raped
and
none
of
you
women
are
ever
concerned
about
raping
us
i've
had
a
crazy
ex
seduce
me
and
continue
to
do
so
even
after
i
told
her
no
was
i
raped
some
of
you
may
say
yes
but
to
be
fair
i
quite
enjoyed
the
ride
despite
the
horrible
guilt
i
felt
afterwards
but
in
the
end
i
let
it
happen
the
guilt
and
responsibility
for
this
was
mine
and
mine
alone
i
do
not
condone
rape
and
i
keep
away
from
girls
that
i
see
are
visibly
drunk
however
i
really
wish
the
rules
and
culture
were
more
consistent
than
the
madness
that
is
currently
going
on
if
you
can't
bench
at
least
eight
and
half
neutron
stars
why
do
you
even
bother
going
to
the
gym

one
of
the
main
reasons
i
applied
ed
to
cornell
was
that
i
really
like
this
girl
and
she
is
no
doubt
smarter
than
me
so
i
thought
she
would
take
me
more
seriously
if
i
was
going
to
an
ivy
she
didn't
apply
to
a
single
ivy
even
though
2360
sat
urm
status
when
i
asked
her
why
it
slipped
i
don't
want
to
go
to
school
with
those
snobby
people
wtf
how
can
you
so
ignorantly
sum
up
the
student
bodies
of
8
schools
but
i
still
kinda
like
her
15015
i
hate
how
easily
gdi's
are
judged
and
frowned
upon
it's
sad
that
people
judge
so
quick
and
don't
even
think
to
consider
what
reasons
there
could
be
that
they
didn't
join
greek
life
maybe
they
couldn't
afford
maybe
they
didn't
get
into
what
they
want
to
maybe
others
were
against
it
who
knows
but
it
disgusts
me
at
cornell
how
often
people
judge
about
greek
life

doesn't
anybody
here
live
at
all
why
can't
we
all
just
have
sex
all
the
time
for
real
why
not
i
don't
care
if
it
kills
everyone
by
spreading
disease
and
crap
it'd
be
so
much
fun
and
we
are
destroying
the
world
any
way
really
getting
tired
of
hearing
people
complain
about
how
skinny
models
are
models
are
that
thin
because
clothing
looks
best
on
the
hanger
you
aren't
supposed
to
look
like
that
just
as
much
as
you
aren't
supposed
to
take
designer's
ridiculous
outfits
and
wear
them
around
on
the
street
and
really
you
aren't
aware
that
images
are
photoshopped
in
this
day
and
age
i
learned
what
photoshop
was
when
i
was
a
child
and
was
able
to
surmise
from
there
that
these
women
were
beautiful
but
i
could
probably
look
flawless
too
with
the
help
of
computers
i
guess
that's
just
rational
privilege
though

i
was
a
mess
you
were
fine
after
i
had
time
to
heal
i
was
so
sure
that
i
was
done
with
you
and
now
you're
telling
me
you
think
you've
made
a
mistake
and
i'm
lost
all
over
again
i
feel
like
i'm
on
this
terrible
rollercoaster
of
emotion
and
i
have
no
idea
what
happens
when
the
ride
is
over
do
we
get
off
together
or
do
we
go
our
separate
ways
so
i'm
in
class
right
now
sitting
all
by
myself
in
the
back
when
all
of
a
sudden
this
random
girl
decides
to
park
herself
in
the
seat
directly
next
to
me
the
class
is
nearly
empty
compared
to
a
regular
day
right
now
why
next
to
me
there
are
seats
everywhere
i
have
no
problem
with
this
but
i
have
to
fart
really
bad
and
don't
want
to
get
up
cuz
i'm
too
comfortable
i
think
i
should
let
it
rip
and
say
happy
halloween
to
her
with
a
smile
as
she
smells

not
this

a

make

weird
a

of

only
post
things
about
drinking
and
hookups
and
tumblr
jokes
and
i
just
don't
really
know
much
about
any
of
those
things
i
wish
that
all
these
pages
made
me
feel
closer
to
my
classmates
but
they
actually
just
make
me
feel
more
alienated
where
the
introverted
whovians
at

sites
always
ask
me
what
i
want
most
in
a

i
always
answer
with
my

but
rarely
get
responses
i'm
sad
that
my
friend
had
to
cancel
a
party
because
he
was
feeling

i

currently
exclusive
with
three
guys
oops
what
is
up
with
girls
going
to
clubs
and
not
wanting
to
dance
why
are
you
even
there
why
is
there
hostility
about
the
people
throwing
parties
at
this
school
cc
students
have
created
an
amazingly
inclusive
party
culture
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
is
it
true
some
of
the
panhellenic
frats
here
on
campus
are
racist

so
i
have
been
crushing
hard
on
this
brother
from
sae
i
first
saw
him
at
the
greek
week
bowling
night
and
now
i
feel
like
i
see
him
everywhere
who
are
you
btw
your

is

i
almost

let's
give

second
go

ugh
the
weather
is
getting
nicer
which
means
more
assholes
wearing
boat
shoes
and
salmon
colored
shorts
would
it
kill
people
here
to
try
and
dress
a
little
more
originally
on
halloween
i
was
drunkenly
walking
down
the
street
and
saw
someone
dressed
up
as
the
tin
man
i
proceeded
to
repeatedly
yell
does
the
tin
man
have
a
sheet
metal
cock
didn't
get
an
answer
guess
i'll
never
know
i
looked
up
check
your
privilege
on
urban
dictionary
here's
what
it
had
to
say
about
it
a
term
screamed
by
far
left
sheltered
liberals
when
they
hear
a
white
person
say
something
that
might
offend
someone
that
isn't
a
straight
white
male
you
will
have
this
term
screamed
at
you
if
say
anything
offensive
to
the
lgbt
blacks
or
any
other
kind
of
person
thats
not
white
straight
or
male
the
term
is
stupid
because
while
these
hippie
liberals
think
these
minor
social
problems
are
big
in
america
and
that
those
affected
by
them
have
their
lives
ruined
by
any
kind
of
hatred
here
they
think
therefor
the
same
social
issues
are
a
big
deal
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
they
forget
that
places
like
somalia
exist
where
you
will
be
murdered
just
for
being
alive
let
alone
being
white
or
gay
can
i
get
an
amen
16470
if
there
are
"20,000"
people
at
this
school
why
do
i
feel
so
alone
5447
i
am
a
person
of
color
and
i
feel
like
the
itooamnyu
movement
looks
like
a
bunch
of
us
minority
groups
bitching
about
random
shit
for
attention
instead
of
actively
working
to
stop
it
this
movement
excludes
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
our
allies
isn't
that
counterproductive

hi
my

am

i
have
no

what
tamu
stands
for
is
that
a
pharmacy
11674
it
seems
like
whenever
i
study
in
a
group
i
seem
to
know
the
material
the
best
but
everyone
in
that
groups
always
ends
up
getting
a
higher
grade
than
me
i
just
want
to
beat
the
mean
and
get
an
a
on
a
test
i
really
haven't
done
well
on
a
single
test
this
year
despite
adamant
efforts
of
studying
i
know
i'm
not
a
complete
idiot
and
it
drives
me
crazy
knowing
that
all
the
mediocre
students
i
knew
from
high
school
that
attend
other
colleges
non
ivy's
are
pulling
4.0
s
with
minimal
effort
they
all
feel
a
sense
of
self
entitlement
while
i'm
busting
my
ass
only
to
score
a
standard
deviation
below
the
mean
what
am
i
doing
with
my
life
you
talkin
to
me
you
talkin
to
me
you
talkin
to
me
then
who
the
hell
else
are
you
talking
you
talking
to
me
well
i'm
the
only
one
here
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you're
talking
to
oh
yeah
ok
draws
pistol
i
can't
wait
for
the
day
the
admins
decide
to
make
some
and
extort
all
those
who
have
made
some
really
red
ass
confessions
maybe
not
this
year
maybe
not
before
you
graduate
but
soon
most
of
you
will
have
pretty
high
paying
jobs
which
confessions
so
far
are
the
most
memorable
the
ones
that
could
really
be
held
for
good
ransom
so
i
got
a
ticket
driving
to
cstat
fuck
tha
police
anyway
the
dumb
pig
put
the
wrong
make
year
and
model
on
the
ticket
how
should
i
contest
this
ticket
being
in
the
library
makes
me
have
to
shit
i
think
it's
an
association
thing
but
i
don't
understand
it
maybe
it's
my
body
just
trying
to
give
me
an
excuse
to
get
up
and
leave
my
work
i
dunno
but
i
don't
like
shitting
in
public
bathrooms
so
it's
kinda
a
pain
literally
anyone
else
experience
this
phenomenon
has
anyone
here
played
assassins
creed
iv
yet
i
am
playing
it
on

am

and
smoke
some
weed
before
or
after
ya
hear
me
11922
there's
a
girl
on
my
floor
who
transferred
in
this
semester
and
lives
in
a
single
it
makes
me
sad
when
she
locks
her
door
just
to
go
to
the
bathroom
about
15
feet
away
does
she
really
not
trust
people
enough
to
leave
it
open
no
one
on
this
floor
that
i've
met
would
go
into
a
room
in
the
3
minutes
she's
gone
i
literally
chuckle
every
time
that
i
see
a
guy
i
personally
know
on
tinder
who
i
know
for
a
fact
has
a
girlfriend
like
seriously
is
having
someone
who
cares
about
you
not
enough
confession
whether
it
would
bother
the
girl
about
their
boyfriends
using
tinder
or
not
i
want
to
message
them
tell
them
11488
i
think
my
girlfriend
and
i
are
not
compatible
but
neither
of
us
is
willing
to
say
something
since
we're
going
to
be
seeing
each
other
so
much
this
summer
i
still
find
her
highly
attractive
but
she
doesn't
seem
to
feel
the
same
in
how
she
acts
around
me
what
should
i
do
can
it
be
syllabus
week
every
week
is
it
bad
to
have
told
two
people
they
are
my
valentines
1271
i
believe
that
this
page
simply
exemplifies
the
modern
generations
disturbingly
voyeuristic
tendencies
with
that
said
i
have
read
every
single
confession
and
shared
them
with
my
friends
multiple
times
at
least
i
know
i
could
be
doing
better
things
right
that's
the
spirit
when
did
brown
university
confessions
turn
into
brown
university
microaggressions
are
we
becoming
close
friends
or
is
this
leading
to
something
else
it's
cool
either
way
but
i
think
we'd
be
pretty
good
together
i'm
a
guy
and
i'm
still
a
virgin
i
go
to
parties
and
hookup
with
girls
but
haven't
found
the
perfect
girl
yet
also
does
being
a
virgin
turn
on
girls
2463
to
all
on
georgetown
confessions
i
think
it's
time
that
we
all
accept
that
gc
has
devolved
into
a
space
that
is
neither
constructive
nor
uplifting
instead
it
serves
as
a
place
for
people
to
share
their
real
or
perceived
grievances
with
others
please
do
not
take
this
as
a
criticism
of
gc
itself
it
only
serves
as
a
vessel
for
the
words
that
individuals
choose
to
share
whether
your
insecurity
stems
from
wealth
or
lack
thereof
a
perception
that
you
should
have
gone
to
a
better
school
or
a
belief
that
people
don't
appreciate
your
beauty
charisma
wit
etc
there
are
simply
better
and
more
constructive
ways
to
vent
your
frustration
than
online
and
from
behind
a
curtain
of
anonymity
no
less
please
stop
spewing
hatred
jealousy
and
petty
slights
it
doesn't
help
you
it
doesn't
help
me
it
doesn't
help
anyone
it
creates
an
environment
so
toxic
and
reeking
of
distrust
and
animosity
that
no
hazmat
crew
could
clean
it
up
a
if
you
go
to
this
school
be
kind
and
work
hard
you
will
be
fine
monetarily
and
otherwise
with
that
said
never
allow
someone's
material
wealth
to
serve
as
an
indicator
of
their
self
worth
or
yours
some
of
the
most
successful
and
influential
people
i
have
met
in
my
life
were
not
the
wealthiest
holler
at
all
my
favorite
underpaid
junior
and
adjunct
professors
b
you're
at
an
amazing
school
fine
so
it's
not
harvard
yale
or
princeton
but
if
that
bothers
you
get
over
it
you're
here
make
the
very
best
of
your
amazing
world
class
education
and
if
you
really
believe
that
you
were
meant
to
go
hyp
then
apply
to
transfer
c
those
that
don't
appreciate
your
qualities
aren't
necessarily
flawed
or
bad
people
everyone
here
is
very
busy
and
sucked
into
their
own
lives
and
circles
which
is
completely
normal
life
is
too
short
to
give
a
damn
what
others
outside
of
family
and
close
friends
think
of
you
never
mistake
scarcity
for
value
we
as
a
school
and
a
community
are
only
as
strong
as
our
weakest
link
so
rather
than
acting
like
petulant
and
petty
children
everyone
that
is
tempted
to
write
something
hurtful
spurning
or
vindictive
on
this
page
please
stop
and
ask
yourself
these
two
questions
would
i
write
this
if
it
wasn't
anonymous
will
what
i
am
about
to
say
make
this
school
a
better
place
sincerely
andrew
reichardt
ask
the
audience
time
what
are
y'alls
opinions
about
learning
a
language
for
a
girl
no
i
don't
want
to
hear
what
language
who
is
it
for
etc
don't
want
to
give
everything
away
in
one
post
haha
i
just
want
to
know
what
are
some
of
your
thoughts
about
doing
this
maybe
even
some
advice
from
both
the
guys
and

when
i
went
back
home
a
friend
of
a
friend
in
high
school
asked
me
what
college
was
like
i
simply
replied
i
go
to
cornell
ever
heard
of
it
i'm
set
to
graduate
in
4
years
i
never
study
i'm
drunk
the
whole
time
and
i
sing
in
the
acapella
group
here
comes
treble
i
couldn't
keep
a
straight
face
but
he
took
me
seriously
late
night
confessions
i
think
so
confess
confess
confess
i
was
wondering
if
everyone
is
so
upset
over
the
new
logo
design
why
isn't
anyone
writing
a
letter
i've
debated
making
a
survey
monkey
and
getting
some
data
to
be
able
to
put
into
a
letter
so
i
can
actually
back
up
my
words
with
something
but
i'm
worried
that
no
one
would
do
it
if
the
whole
outrage
over
the
new
logo
thing
is
a
fad
that
will
pass
by
spring
term
and
then
i'd
look
foolish
thoughts
people
who
post
their
schedules
up
on
the
class
pages
at
the
beginning
of
each
semester
dafuq
is
wrong
withcu
no
one
cares
so
we
would
in
fact
have
to
confess
said
secret
to
someone
in
a
private
message
right
what
if
the
person
running
this
is
part
of
my
secret
o
i've
always
dreamed
of
being
woken
up
to
fun
sexytimes
so
finally
it
happens
and
this
is
what
i
do

is
noah
pazdral
single
though
i
am
not
a
rice
student
yet
but
i
honestly
love
you
guys
to
death
before
i
discovered
rice
there
was
another
college
i
wanted
to
go
to
and
when
i
wrote
on
its
confession
board
one
day
as
a
confused
lovesick
little
highschooler
everyone
flamed
me
and
generally
acted
pretty
horrible
a
lot
of
people
on
this
page
don't
go
to
rice
but
you
guys
are
nice
to
everyone
no
matter
who
or
what
they
are
i
sincerely
hope
i
can
join
you
guys
next
year
i
have
loved
rice
for
almost
a
year
now
and
i
can't
imagine
a
better
place
for
me
1089
do
we
get
surf
and
turf
for
reaching
1000
likes
for
georgetown
confessions
or
is
that
just
leos
today
when
someone
asked
how
my
day
went
i
was
soo
tempted
to
say
pretty
good
watched
a
lot
of
porn
but
i
was
scared
he
would
see
me
differently
why
is
this
still
taboo
is
is
weird
for
a
guy
to
be
able
to
like
orgasm
3x
in
one
go
sometimes
lol
let's
go
to
the
sea
before
sunrise
the
city
lights
go
out
one
by
one
the
stars
fade
then
the
horizon
glows
almost
like
its
on
fire
it's
kinda
rose
colored
right
first
the
sea
then
it
spreads
to
the
sky
then
to
the
whole
city
it
gets
brighter
and
brighter
till
everything
glows
its
really
pretty
i
know
you'd
like
it

ps3
really
really
made
me
sad
that
and
all
of
the
prelims
i
have
this
week
just
make
me
so
so
sad
i
was
waiting
for
class
yesterday
and
i
was
on
the
3rd
floor
duffield
bridge
i
looked
down
and
this
familiar
feeling
came
back
again
it
would
be
so
easy
to
just
let
it
all
go
to
accidentally
trip
over
the
railing
i
thought
i
had
gotten
over
my
suicidal
thoughts
when
i
came
to
cornell
and
got
away
from
my
abusive
family
obviously
not
what
am
i
doing
with
my
life
you
know
what
i
love
beating
women
to
the
door
so
i
may
open
it
for
them
915
during
the
fall
quarter
one
night
i
had
been
drinking
with
some
of
my
friends
particularly
because
this
girl
i
was
dating
wanted
to
see
me
drink
i
passed
out
on
her
couch
woke
up
a
little
after
6
am
and
walked
home
my
roommate's
girlfriend
was
up
at
7
as
she
always
is
getting
ready
for
work
when
she
saw
me
she
asked
if
i
had
just
gotten
home
yeah
i
just
walked
home
where
are
your
pants
i
feel
especially
stupid
because
before
i
left
my
friend's
place
i
consciously
thought
you're
going
back
to
your
place
you
need
your
keys
and
unclipped
my
keys
from
my
pants
which
were
on
the
floor
but
forgot
my
pants
and
not
once
did
i
stop
during
my
walk
to
think
about
how
cold
it
was
hmm
what
should
i
buy
a
1980
s
national
match
m1a
or
a
s
w
m
p
340
decisions
decisions
what
do
y'all
think
17506
isn't
it
funny
how
you've
met
someone
and
in
a
short
time
all
you
can
think
about
is
that
person
i
wish
you
knew
i
just
don't
want
to
come
across
as
an
emotional
guy
but
i
honestly
can't
stop
thinking
about
you
i
get
disappointed
whenever
i
receive
a
text
message
and
it
is
not
from
you
i
want
you
girl
please
be
mine
10428
i
just
want
to
have
really
rough
sex
with
a
guy
i
want
someone
to
slap
me
around
spank
me
choke
me
and
pull
my
hair
would
it
be
weird
to
ask
a
one
night
stand
to
do
me
this
way
3077
to
everyone
on
this
page
who
has
been
singling
out
pre
med
students
sfs
students
col
students
msb
students
etc
etc
etc
i
want
you
to
consider
for
a
moment
what
this
school
would
be
like
if
everyone
had
the
same
major
and
future
goals
as
you
maybe
it
would
be
easier
to
understand
each
other
and
maybe
it
would
be
a
little
less
frustrating
we
would
all
have
the
same
assignments
all
the
time
so
we
wouldn't
have
to
argue
about
whose
workload
was
harder
we
would
all
understand
each
others
passions
and
interests
and
maybe
it
would
be
fun
for
a
while
but
wouldn't
this
also
be
really
boring
we
would
miss
out
on
opportunities
to
see
the
world
through
a
different
lens
and
through
someone
else's
eyes
we
might
not
have
the
chance
to
have
our
firmly
held
beliefs
challenged
by
others
with
different
values
we
might
miss
something
crucial
when
solving
a
problem
because
we
would
all
approach
it
the
same
way
we
would
eventually
all
go
on
to
do
similar
things
with
our
lives
but
then
what
would
we
be
left
with
a
world
full
of
doctors
a
world
full
of
policy
makers
a
world
full
of
businessmen
and
women
our
strengths
are
in
our
differences
together
we
come
together
to
build
something
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
as
a
community
with
different
passions
and
pursuits
we
are
each
able
to
contribute
something
special
and
unique
that
the
world
desperately
needs
so
here
is
my
challenge
to
you
embrace
these
differences
open
yourself
up
to
learning
new
things
from
other
people
who
have
different
interests
follow
your
own
unique
passions
and
find
a
way
to
use
them
that
builds
up
our
community
and
our
world
celebrate
the
things
that
make
each
of
us
special
and
unique
and
let's
make
this
one
welcoming
hoya
family
988
i
know
the
sex
didn't
mean
anything
but
thank
you
for
telling
me
i'm
beautiful
because
i
know
you
meant
that
even
if
you've
already
forgotten
about
that
night
i
still
have
been
feeling
more
beautiful
and
in
control
of
my
womanhood
ever
since
i
don't
know
what
it
is
about
sex
that
makes
me
feel
strong
as
a
woman
it's
not
the
only
thing
in
my
life
that
feels
that
way
it
could
be
making
grown
men
scream
and
squeal
like
girls
out
of
pleasure
that
gives
me
pride
but
mostly
it's
that
no
matter
how
strong
they
act
when
i
leave
their
beds
in
that
moment
during
the
sex
and
after
when
we
fall
asleep
that
they
are
extremely
open
and
vulnerable
they
think
they're
the
ones
doing
the
seducing
please
a
m
has
ruined
religion
for
me
everybody
here
is
your
typical
bible
thumping
evangelist
and
i
fucking
hate
it
im
so
tired
of
seeing
inspirational
god
quotes
written
all
over
my
dorm
bible
verses
written
on
the
sidewalks
people
coming
up
to
others
to
shove
god
down
their
throat
and
our
facebook
confessions
page
full
of
people
talking
about
how
much
they
love
god
im
fucking
sick
of
it
i
am
very
much
a
person
who
worships
privately
so
getting
all
this
shit
shoved
down
my
throat
constantly
is
getting
so
fucking
old
i
dont
need
some
fake
ass
sorority
girl
to
tell
me
that
they
can
save
my
soul
i
dont
want
to
look
at
another
confession
saying
direct
quote
god
designed
women
to
get
married
and
raise
a
family
to
get
to
heaventhat
is
the
ultimate
job
god
made
for
womenwomen
are
to
serve
their
families
like
jesus
because
jesus
was
the
servant
among
men
im
so
tired
of
my
family
telling
me
if
i
dont
get
to
church
every
single
sunday
im
going
to
hell
that
if
i
mess
up
one
time
there
is
no
forgiveness
im
tired
of
people
using
religion
as
fucking
leverage
to
get
me
to
do
what
they
want
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
the
majority
of
people
who
are
religious
are
fucking
ignorant
they
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
theyre
going
to
save
me
but
they
persecute
everybody
in
the
name
of
god
and
completely
ignore
the
fact
that
god
said
in
the
bible
to
love
everybody
and
let
him
do
the
judging
they
judge
and
persecute
everyone
anyway
and
still
hold
themselves
above
others
i
hate
all
of
this
im
fucking
done
being
catholic
i
hate
a
religion
that
is
inherently
sexist
and
discriminatory
im
not
doing
this
anymore
i
wish
so
bad
that
i
had
never
come
here
i
love
a
m
but
most
of
the
people
here
fucking
suck
theyre
a
bunch
of
intolerant
evangelist
wanna
be
rednecks
that
are
so
close
minded
that
its
physically
painful
so
fucking
thanks
to
everybody
who
ruined
the
one
thing
i
truly
appreciated
about
my
upbringing
what
are
the
best
brands
of
vibrators
and
what
are
the
best
websites
to
buy
them
specificaally
vibrators
with
really
strong
vibration
settings
and
different
speeds
or
features
all
advice
is
welcome

how
important
am
i
to
you
so
that
you
can
just
throw
me
away
the
second
you
feel
like
i've
wronged
you
i
thought
we
grew
close
over
the
summer
does
making
you
angry
a
few
times
for
accidentally
being
insensitive
mean
you're
going
to
forget
about
it
all
we
used
to
be
able
to
joke
about
those
things
now
i
feel
like
i'm
treading
thin
ice
when
i'm
talking
to
you
i've
apologized
and
let
go
of
my
ego
and
you've
trampled
over
them
by
dismissing
them
after
hurtful
rants
and
there's
only
so
much
of
that
i
can
take
i
started
talking
about
these
things
to
my
friends
and
they've
called
you
a
nutcase
i
still
want
to
try
a
relationship
but
let's
work
things
out
it
literally
annoys
the
shit
out
of
me
that
people
wear
shirts
hats
sweaters
etc
from
other
schools
where
is
the
pride
honestly
i'm
sorry
you
didn't
get
into
that
other
school
but
in
the
words
of
crosby
stills
and
nash
if
you
can't
be
with
the
one
you
love
love
the
one
you're
with

i'm
not
100
comfortable
around
gay
people
i
am
first
generation
american
born
and
raised
by
a
traditional
slightly
macho
immigrant
household
i
was
sent
to
a
catholic
school
grades
k
8
and
my
father
is
a
fervent
bible
reader.i
grew
up
in
nyc
submersed
in
an
urban
hip
hop
culture
which
frowns
upon
homosexuality
and
uses
gay
slurs
liberally
it
wasn't
until
i
started
college
and
ventured
into
the
world
of
academia
that
i
started
to
become
increasingly
appreciative
of
different
peoples
cultures
and
walks
of
life
now
don't
get
me
wrong
i'm
all
for
gay
rights
equality
tolerance
and
acceptance
if
you
asked
me
a
series
of
questions
i'd
give
you
all
the
right
answers
any
reasonable
just
person
would
and
should
give
i
can
talk
to
gay
people
treat
them
respectfully
and
don't
hate
them
in
any
way
or
think
they're
wrong
this
is
not
about
how
i
feel
about
gays
on
a
societal
or
ethical
level
i'm
agnostic
and
don't
subscribe
to
any
particular
set
of
tenets
this
is
just
about
me
personally
growing
up
i
never
really
had
much
interactions
with
gay
people
in
fact
it
wasn't
really
until
i
started
dating
my
ex
who
had
a
lot
of
gay
friends
that
i
started
being
exposed
to
gay
people
with
greater
frequency
and
i
realized
i
felt
a
bit
uncomfortable
however
i
wanted
to
force
myself
to
overcome
this
aversion
so
i
made
sure
to
be
social
and
would
even
go
out
to
gay
bars
clubs
with
my
ex
and
her
friends
sometimes
i
figured
the
more
i
expose
myself
to
being
around
gay
people
the
quicker
i'll
get
over
myself
unfortunately
even
after
all
that
and
even
after
many
other
subsequent
interactions
with
gay
people
i
still
don't
feel
fully
comfortable
around
them
the
fact
that
i'm
what
some
would
consider
a
good
looking
metrosexual
doesn't
really
help
either
because
often
times
my
interactions
with
gay
people
result
in
them
hitting
on
me
which
only
causes
me
to
withdraw
back
into
my
comfort
zone
i
used
to
think
i
was
the
only
one
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
society
as
a
whole
has
spent
literally
thousands
of
years
admonishing
homosexuality
in
one
way
or
another
and
to
think
that
a
people
can
just
wake
up
one
morning
and
be
100
we
love
gays
after
just
a
few
decades
of
progressive
movements
reality
shows
and
pride
parades
seems
implausible
like
any
evolution
there
has
to
be
a
transition
perhaps
i
represent
that
transition
is
that
wrong
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
my
upbringing
has
instilled
me
with
a
certain
bias
while
i
know
better
now
and
have
made
great
strides
to
overcome
such
a
silly
predisposition
it's
difficult
for
me
to
completely
erase
this
vestigial
bias
and
i
just
wonder
will
i
ever
furthermore
i
wonder
if
the
feeling
of
discomfort
i
get
around
gays
isn't
caused
by
them
directly
but
rather
the
dissonance
experienced
as
my
mind
tries
to
wipe
out
my
senseless
vestigial
prejudice
before
you
point
fingers
though
ask
yourself
are
you
100
comfortable
around
all
kinds
of
people
and
walks
of
life
accepting
and
tolerant
sure
but
what
about
comfortable
then
again
so
long
as
you
support
people's
rights
and
causes
does
you
being
comfortable
even
matter
or
is
comfort
a
level
of
acceptance
that's
unnecessary
it
may
not
matter
on
a
societal
level
but
i'm
trying
to
be
the
best
person
i
can
be
so
i
guess
on
a
personal
level
to
me
it
does
in
any
case
while
it
may
be
too
late
for
me
i'll
be
sure
to
avoid
instilling
such
bias
in
my
own
children
so
they
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
same
foolish
discord
896
connor
smith
from
the
crew
team
i
fantasize
about
doing
you
six
ways
to
sunday
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
smoking
cigars
i
knew
i
wanted
a
piece
of
that
new
trier
ass
north
shore
admirer
ps
see
you
at
lolla
this
summer
i'm
sick
of
being
cheated
on
and
lied
to
why
does
this
keep
happening
to
me
2611
i
thought
i
was
falling
out
of
love
with
my
boyfriend
we
met
after
3
weeks
today
and
he
took
me
out
on
a
date
roses
chocolates
a
three
course
meal
he
made
from
scratch
and
the
best
orgasm
i
ever
had
until
his
sister
walked
in
on
us
even
so
best
day
ever
did
i
mention
how
much
i
love
him
9135
if
one
of
the
twins
on
the
track
team
already
has
a
boyfriend
and
the
other
one
hopefully
doesn't
then
someone
tell
me
which
of
these
tall
beautiful
blondes
is
single
so
i
can
snag
the
last
one
this
is
to
the
girls
who
complain
about
foreskin
on
our
dicks
whats
the
big
deal
about
it
this
is
how
we
were
naturally
brought
into
this
world
and
its
our
parents
who
had
the
final
say
on
whether
or
not
it
was
cut
of
at
birth
we
didn't
have
voices
to
tell
em
ive
hooked
up
with
a
couple
of
girls
while
at
a
m
none
had
an
issue
with
it
so
why
do
some
have
this
issue
i
really
want
to
know
the
reason
so
please
do
elaborate
on
this
subject
15219
i
can't
help
but
notice
that
a
large
portion
of
the
posts
on
here
involve
loneliness
and
or
a
lack
of
confidence
as
someone
who's
been
down
this
road
before
i'm
going
to
be
frank
let
me
help
some
of
you
lovable
losers
out
a
gym
money
and
some
kind
of
showy
hobby
you
excel
at
will
solve
most
of
your
problems
a
gym
will
make
you
better
looking
which
will
get
you
more
opportunities
to
socialize
sad
but
true
the
better
looking
you
are
the
more
people
will
want
to
be
around
you
and
interactions
with
the
opposite
sex
it
will
also
make
you
more
confident
so
you'll
carry
yourself
better
and
together
with
more
opportunities
to
socialize
you'll
become
less
socially
awkward
and
eventually
become
an
unstoppable
social
juggernaut
money
will
let
you
make
the
most
out
of
your
social
interactions
take
girls
out
on
nicer
dates
and
dress
better
that's
right
dorks
style
matters
the
easiest
way
to
go
about
this
is
to
get
a
job
but
some
of
you
trust
fund
babies
probably
already
have
your
parent's
credit
cards
on
hand
put
it
to
good
use
a
hobby
your
good
at
gives
you
easy
common
grounds
to
meet
people
and
makes
you
more
interesting
excelling
at
the
hobby
is
important
because
no
matter
what
you
always
have
something
you
can
fall
back
on
that
paints
you
in
a
dominant
light
and
allows
you
to
work
display
yourself
from
a
position
of
strength
a
wise
saying
my
uncle
once
told
me
loosely
translated
to
english
the
rooster
is
boldest
in
his
coop
i
realize
this
stuff
is
largely
superficial
but
that's
really
all
that's
missing
for
most
of
you
style
confidence
and
social
skills
you're
at
cornell
because
you're
smart
guess
what
so
is
everyone
else
nerds
here
are
a
dime
a
dozen
what's
going
to
help
you
stand
out
here's
a
hint
it's
not
your
silver
ti
84
hopefully
this
helps
someone
why
do
you
have
to
act
like
you're
better
than
everything
you're
a
person
just
like
everyone
else
you're
not
some
transcendent
being
of
perfection
just
because
you've
won
some
things
and
gotten
praised
and
you're
definitely
not
special
because
your
favorite
singer
is
successful
that
doesn't
even
make
any
sense
look
everyone's
a
person
whether
their
life
is
moving
up
or
down
at
the
moment
just
be
considerate
be
humble
be
friendly
be
a
person

so
i'm
transferring
in
this
fall
to
georgetown
and
i'm
a
little
nervous
i'm
kind
of
shy
and
i
feel
like
people
have
already
established
friendships
groups
by
their
second
or
third
year
any
tips
on
how
to
connect
i
think
rice
confessions
is
a
waste
of
time
its
just
here
for
people
to
whine
about
shit
so
what
if
your
heart
got
broken
get
over
it
so
what
if
you
failed
a
class
get
over
it
so
what
if
you
don't
have
friends
go
be
a
functioning
member
of
society
and
get
your
lazy
ass
from
in
front
of
your
computer
and
no
one
cares
about
if
you
like
to
masturbate
upside
down
or
the
other
weird
shit
that
you
guys
do
so
you
can
shut
up
about
that
too
god

how
does
one
tell
a
nearly
lifelong
friend
that
one
has
no
further
interest
in
maintaining
said
friendship
especially
when
the
friend
has
done
nothing
wrong
please
be
my
shrink
lc
this
has
been
driving
me
nuts
during
a
time
when
school
is
doing
quite
enough
of
that
already
it
truly
saddens
me
when
i
see
an
obese
individual
overeating
unhealthy
foods
no
i
don't
find
it
disgusting
it
just
makes
me
sad
if
i
could
talk
to
them
about
being
healthy
i
would
but
i
don't
want
them
to
take
it
the
wrong
way
and
be
highly
offended
i
just
hope
and
pray
they
find
their
way
to
a
healthy
lifestyle
one
day
does
this
make
me
a
jerk

i
have
a
crush
on
this
girl
in
my
class
but
whenever
i
talk
to
her
she
is
just
so
awkward
i
wonder
if
she
is
worthwhile
to
pursue
my
last
relationship
was
really
boring
so
maybe
the
idea
of
dating
a
crazy
awkward
person
turns
me
on
when
i'm
not
speaking
to
you
why
do
men
think
about
sex
so
much

horror
and
unleash
the
dark
god
cthulu
whose

the
dying

of
ten
thousand
souls
with
is
that
too
much
to
ask
question
is
okcupid
a
thing
for
people
our
age
now
growing
up
i
thought
i'd
never
ever
do
online
dating
or
that
if
i
did
it'd
be
when
i
was
older
like
mid
30
s
but
i
hear
that
people
at
cc
are
using
it
thoughts
i
know
this
isn't
a
confession
but
i
didn't
feel
comfortable
asking
this
question
without
anonymity
i'd
love
it
if
you'd
post
it
anyways
15190
dammit
i
really
wanna
talk
to
her
but
what
should
i
say
besides
isn't
it
weird
to
start
a
facebook
conversation
to
talk
about
nothing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
what's
the
best
humanities
class
to
take
13586
13544
i
despise
them
too
so
what
if
it's
my
parents
paying
for
it
my
family
has
to
pay
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
for
my
education
you
don't
ever
i
wish
the
only
financial
aid
cornell
gave
was
interest
free
loans
then
everyone
will
have
to
pay
the
same
price
for
the
same
education
does
anybody
have
a
picture
of
those
graffiti
clown
faces
that
appeared
on
campus
a
few
years
back
88
would
love
to
spend
a
sensual
evening
with
the
tennis
player
on
lunt
fourth
my
only
hope
is
that
he's
into
nerf
what's
a
man
without
a
love
for
guns
278
276
and
275
fuck
tinder
i
want
it
only
specific
to
haverford
and
what
about
people
without
androids
or
mac's
how
do
we
access
this
app
there
has
to
be
an
easier
way
we
can
go
about
this
you're
not
a
man
more
like
a
chick
with
a
dick
and
the
fact
that
you
let
your
bros
change
who
you
are
as
a
person
just
shows
how
weak
you
let
yourself
be
your
bestie
he
can't
change
his
fiance
so
he
changes
you
bahaha
grow
a
backbone
cause
you
will
end
up
a
chick
with
a
vagina
instead
i'm
tired
of
all
of
these
so
called
dj's
and
dubstep
artists
that
unh
and
scope
bring
to
us
like
for
real
can't
we
bring
in
a
musician
or
singer
with
real
talent
first
off
i'm
not
a
fan
of
paying
a
ridiculous
amount
of
money
to
watch
somebody
at
a
turntable
its
essentially
a
40
dance
party
not
to
mention
everyone
there
is
zooted
i
would
pay
big
dollars
to
see
a
rapper
like
nas
or
kendrick
lamar
or
a
band
like
slightly
stoopid
or
third
eye
blind
step
your
game
up
scope
i
don't
get
why
people
insist
on
being
assholes
do
i
think
the
huge
jacked
up
truck
is
stupid
sure
but
i'm
not
about
to
go
screaming
to
them
about
it
i
wouldn't
do
it
but
hey
more
power
to
you
do
what
you
like
don't
like
greek
life
bonfire
corps
insert
whatever
group
here
fine
don't
join
it
find
something
that
you
like
but
why
mock
people
in
it
if
a
greek
member
bonfire
member
corps
member
was
an
asshole
they
aren't
the
majority
every
group
has
douchebags
they
are
the
exception
not
the
rule
don't
condemn
a
whole
group
because
of
it
oh
and
the
obsession
over
what
people
wear
as
long
as
they
aren't
prancing
around
fucking
naked
calm
down
you
don't
have
to
like
the
big
t
shirt
fad
but
don't
be
an
ass
just
because
you
don't
like
it
let
them
do
them
you
do
you
same
with
people
dressing
country
not
to
mention
don't
fucking
fat
shame
if
you
think
someone
is
too
large
for
those
shorts
skirt
or
whatever
here's
an
idea
don't
look
seriously
making
fun
of
someone
for
their
body
when
they
may
well
already
have
self
esteem
issues
is
a
really
crappy
thing
to
do
is
it
so
hard
to
y'know
not
be
an
asshole
and
mind
your
own
business
do
what
makes
you
happy
what
makes
you
comfortable
and
let
other
people
do
their
thing
without
being
mocked
and
harassed
for
it

i
am
a

student

like

don't
become
an
alcoholic
out
of

4
years
of
continuous
drinking
we

i
was
so
freaked
out
when
i
ran
into
a
group
last
night
with
fire
and
candles
in
the
arts
quad
i
tried
to
walk
around
them
but
then
saw
more
of
them
by
ezra's
statue
what
the
hell
is
going
on
at
this
school
1639
whenever
i
arrive
before
class
starts
i
see
people
sitting
down
and
turning
their
phone
on
vibrate
or
silent
i'm
just
sitting
there
waiting
for
class
to
start
and
not
worry
about
my
phone
going
off
because
no
one
texts
or
calls
me
i
guess
it's
one
less
thing
to
worry
about
does
anyone
know
a
girl
who
owns
a
black
beret
like
artist's
style
and
wears
it
semi
regularly
she
has
long
brown
hair
and
has
a
class
that
ends
at
around
on
mwf
in
architecture
b
her
name
might
be
elizabeth
or
something
along
those
lines

looking
guy
i'm
6'0
190
pounds
with
a
fairly
muscular
build
i've
been
graduated
for
a
while
i'd
like
to
think
i'm
fairly
intelligent
and
i'm
damn
good
at
my
job
i'm
a
musician
and
i'm
pretty
good
at
that
too
everyone
tells
me
how
awesome
i
am
at
everything
bullshit
stop
sparing
me
if
i
was
that
awesome
i
wouldn't
be
so
fucking
lonely
i
wouldn't
hear
that
lie
i
don't
want
to
mess
up
our
friendship
from
every
woman
i've
ever
pursued
regardless
of
how
long
i've
known
her
and
even
when
i
did
get
a
girlfriend
literally
all
of
them
have
cheated
on
me
i've
been
single
for
4
years
and
went
on
one
date
in
my
time
at
a
m
and
it
seemed
like
mostly
a
pity
date
because
although
we
seemed
to
have
a
good
conversation
had
a
great
time
over
all
i
never
heard
from
her
again
and
she
ignored
me
why
do
other
men
just
have
to
exist
and
women
go
out
of
their
way
to
throw
themselves
at
them
while
i
work
and
try
and
get
told
i'm
not
good
enough
no
this
isn't
really
a
confession
but
i
am
sick
of
it
i
don't
know
what
to
do
anymore
i'm
a
freshman
and
my
major
is
biology
and
i
have
a

so
poorly
on

can
someone
help
me
out
here
before
i
go

wtf

i
doing

why

what
the

does
a

or

down

on

13941
so
you're
afraid
what
about
me
stole
my
heart
for
all
to
see
here
i
am
take
me
i'm
yours
i
realize
that
it's
me
being
so
cold
trapped
in
a
box
where
my
heart's
been
for
so
long
i
realize
that
it's
me
being
insecure
would
women
like
it
if
men
commented
on
how
beautiful
they
are
in
a
non
creepy
way
i
see
so
many
gorgeous
women
on
campus
who
look
like
they
are
having
a
bad
day
and
i
feel
like
a
compliment
would
brighten
it
one
of
my
friends
wanted
to
get
back
at
her
ex
for
him
cheating
and
treating
her
like
a
sex
object
so
she
told
him
she
set
up
a
glory
hole
for
him
in
the
13th
floor
of
the
scili
to
get
him
off
at
2am
lol
little
did
he
know
that
the
one
sucking
him
off
was
her
gbf
me
this
is
our
way
of
breaking
the
news
to
him
sorry
not
sorry
i
didn't
get
into
wpi
and
reading
this
page
literally
made
me
cry
all
of
you
please
be
my
friends
shoutout
to
the
kid
who
stole
that
real
estate
sign
when
we
were
walking
down
madbury
last
night
we
watched
that
durham
cop
chase
you
the
fuck
down
into
the
woods
the
question
is
did
you
get
away
or
get
tackled

anyone

uses

want

you
ever
given
someone
everything
you
have
and
then
somehow
regret
not
being
perfect

that
person
that's
me

long
distance
relationships
are
very
difficult
as
much
as
i
love
my
partner
and
am
happy
to
be
in
the
relationship
i
feel
that
we
are
drifting
into
two
different
worlds
i
also
worry
that
my
fear
of
the
factors
that
may
lead
to
breaking
up
are
damaging
my
ability
to
be
sociable
with
others
while
at
cornell
for
withstanding
love
or
for
localized
joy
that
is
the
question
anyone
else
hate
it
when
their
dick
hits
the
back
of
the
urinal
or
is
that
just

what
do
you
miss
about
georgetown
why
did
you
transfer
it'd
be
interesting
to
hear
your
experience
since
so
many
people
on
this
page
complain
about
wanting
to
transfer
would
wearing
my
let's
get
naked
night
shirt
to
classes
tomorrow
be
a
little
too
suggestive
for
a
single
lady
on
campus
i
really
want
to
start
lifting
weights
again
to
get
back
into
shape
and
be
more
toned
like
i
was
in
high
school
my
only
problem
is
that
i'm
scared
to
go
into
the
weight
room
at
the
rec
because
i
don't
want
to
be
judged
for
not
being
able
to
lift
that
much
i'm
a
girl
and
i'm
really
short
in
high
school
when
i
was
lifting
twice
a
week
my
max
on
bench
was
only
100
pounds
so
i
can't
even
imagine
what
it
is
now
that
i'm
out
of
shape
do
people
judge
what
time
is
the
weight
room
not
super
packed
it's
like
there
are
more
and
more
happy
couple
photos
on
my
newsfeed
every
day
screaming
hey
are
you
still
single
you're
still
single
aren't
you
oh
yeah
you're
still
single
well
have
fun
being
single
fuck
this
noise
the
single
life
blows

it
makes
me
uncomfortable
to
hear
about
abortions
occurring
past
24
weeks
into
a
pregnancy
my
aunt
died
in
a
car
crash
when
she
was
24
weeks
into
her
pregnancy
and
her
baby
girl
was
removed
surgically
my
cousin
is
alive
and
well
today
with
no
disabilities
or
long
term
medical
problems
resulting
from
her
premature
birth
if
a
baby
is
capable
of
surviving
without
its
mother
at
that
time
shouldn't
he
she
have
the
right
to
live
even
if
the
mother
no
longer
wishes
to
carry
it
ladies
if
a
good
friend
if
yours
has
feelings
for
you
can
you
tell
2808
have
you
ever
stopped
yourself
around
4
30
pm
and
realized
that
what
you
need
no
matter
what
you
have
planned
for
the
night
is
a
taco
for
dinner
it's
the
strangest
and
yet
most
satisfying
feeling
in
the
world
4096
that
was
the
most
ridiculous
email
nyu
has
ever
sent

to

the
national
weather

has
hazardous

storm
warnings
out
for
the
next
36
hours

warnings
and

i
wish
there
was
a
way
for
people
with
dumb
phones
to
use
tinder
just
because
i
don't
have
a
nice
phone
does
that
make
me
undeserving
of
love
this
is
not
really
a
confession
but
i
have
a
question
about
the
class
search
on
howdy
why
doesn't
the
engl
104
courses
ever
shows
that
teacher
is
going
to
teach
it
why
is
it
that
black
girls
don't
shave
especially
their
armpits
i'm
a
student
and
employee
in
the
department
of
ag
i'm
dating
a
longhorn
oh
did
i
mention
we're
both
dudes
all
these
confessions
are
so
depressing
i
confess
that
i
love
walking
in
the
grove
at
night
because
sometimes
i
get
to
see
that
beautiful
elegant
bird
with
the
long
neck
does
anyone
know
what
kind
of
bird
it
is
it's
gorgeous
have
secrets
share

i
know
a
few
girls
who
get
offended
when
they
hear
guys
comparing
which
girl
is
hotter
and
yet
they
constantly
say
oh
this
guy
is
hotter
than
that
guy
double
standard
girls
are
so
confusing

would
germs
even
work
in

or
is

just
gonna
let
people
in
the
satellite
campus
die
of
alcohol
poisoning
if
they
really
are
shipping
all
the
minorities
over
there
for
cheap

does
that
make
them
a
new
level

racist
11655
there's
this
really
hot
guy
with
purple
lavender
hair
that
i've
seen
a
few
times
and
i
really
just
want
to
know
does
the
carpet
match

and
if
so
can
i
see
it

i
have
no
problems
or
issues
at
all
with
the
lgbtq
community
yet
due
to
force
of
habit
and
peer
conditioning
several
derogatory
words
have
become
part
of
my
vocabulary
i
don't
mean
anything
negative
when
i
use
these
words
i
don't
even
associate
them
with
a
person's
sexual
orientation
anymore
but
i
still
feel
bad
whenever
i
use
it
because
i
know
someone
else
perceives
it
differently
and
may
feel
hurt
by
it
i
don't
know
what
to
do
how
does
someone
forget
a
word
from
their
vocabulary
i
don't
even
consciously
use
it
sometimes
it
just
slips
out
jokingly
on
its
own
dear
cc
boys
my
3
year
olds
learned
how
to
pee
in
the
toilet
bowl
flush
and
wash
their
hands
to
prevent
the
spread
of
germs
why
can't
you
do

sometimes
it
feels
weird
to
be
a
guy
at
cornell
and
not
be
a
complete
douche
but
honestly
what
is
it
about
being
a
guy
at
cornell
and
acting
like
a
sub
human
find
a
way
to
procure
some
manners
class
and
self
respect
is
there
anyway
i
can
sue
peirce
for
damages
to
my
butthole
my
good
condescending
fellow
aggies
i
hereby
confess
i
confess
that
i
am
thirsty
thirsty
for
knowledge
i'm
thirsty
for
recognition
hungry
for
opportunities
i
look
at
my
over
achieving
fellow
peers
observing
how
they
have
come
so
far
in
their
college
life
does
it
inspire
me
i
feel
disappointed
the
thought
of
me
being
unable
to
act
on
the
good
fortunes
i've
been
blessed
with
disturbs
me
to
the
common
man
i
come
across
as
a
jovial
well
to
do
human
being
i
confess
that
i
have
problems
to
deal
with
everyone
one
has
their
share
of
problems
some
may
seem
trivial
some
you
may
find
overwhelming
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
every
problem
no
matter
how
small
hurts
your
psyche
it
affects
your
judgement
it
affects
your
ability
to
think
act
rationally
it
acts
like
a
stream
of
negativity
in
your
otherwise
carefree
college
life
for
those
of
you
who
have
had
a
bad
day
feel
free
to
take
this
confession
as
means
to
vent
out
your
frustration
do
make
fun
of
the
grammar
and
my
not
so
good
grasp
of
the
english
language
for
those
of
you
who
genuinely
seem
to
empathize
take
this
not
as
a
confession
of
a
frustrated
mad
man
but
as
an
effort
from
me
to
arouse
that
sense
of
purpose
in
you
i'd
take
solace
in
the
fact
that
i
was
able
to
be
of
help
i'm
sure
it
was
tl
and
you
dr
at
least
you
tried
i
hope
the
admins
put
my
message
across
i
eagerly
await
to
hear
from
kind
judgemental
people
long
live

make
some
summer
secrets
shall
we
i
can't
get
by
with
my

and
i
can't
provide
the

of

these

diapers
what
do
i
really
want
to
tell
this
confession
i
already
tell
people
but
it's
just
awfully
embarrassing
i
was
a
young
10th
grader
i
played
basketball
and
had
a
friend
on
the
team
it
was
a
tuesday
and
we
had
a
game
that
night
i
went
to
her
house
before
to
chill
get
ready
and
get
pumped
everyone
knows
before
games
you
have
to
poop
and
that
i
did
that
i
did
on
the
second
floor
in
my
friends
bathroom
i
pooped
so
much
in
fact
i
clogged
the
toilet
now
this
isn't
what's
embarrassing
clogging
was
something
i've
done
before
in
that
very
toilet
i
said
uh
oh
and
she
said
angrily
did
you
clog
it
i'm
not
unclogging
it
what
did
it
tell
you
about
courtesy
flushing
i
said
ya
calm
down
i
will
do
it
i
couldn't
find
the
plunger
i
asked
her
for
it
too
i
forgot
and
went
to
my
game
the
next
day
after
practice
her
mother
picked
us
up
in
the
rear
view
mirror
her
mother
looks
at
me
and
asks
did
you
use
the
toilet
yesterday
yes

senior
in
sig
pi
who's
hooked
up
with
me
nearly
all
my
girlfriends
you're
cute
all
but
goddamn
you
are
terrible
in
bed
maybe
you
should
start
drinking
as
much
as
the
blacked
out
girls
you
hookup
with
to
make
it
better
i'd
say
your
name
flat
out
but
i
unlike
you
have
a
certain
level
of
common
decency
most
girls
think
i'm
attractive
i
have
a
nice
v
cut
six
pack
i'm
active
but
for
some
reason
i
can
never
get
a
date
wtf
i
can't
understand
byu
girls

wanna
go
on
a
date
the
ice
age
budget
is
mad
what
were
our
reps
thinking
i'm
really
interested
in
being
a
nutrition
major
sometimes
i
go
around
to
the
different
bathrooms
to
see
if
anyone
forgot
to
flush
their
2
when
i
stumble
upon
a
feces
of
unusual
coloration
i
look
it
up
on
webmd
or
other
similar
sites
to
see
what
the
coloration
indicates
about
their
diet
it's
actually
very
interesting
it
makes
me
want
to
take
down
the
please
flush
posters
i
want
to
tell
my
friends
about
this
because
i'm
so
passionate
about
my
studies
but
i
know
they'll
find
it
weird
and
probably
won't
understand
if
someone
told
you
guys
they
do
this
would
you
judge
them
once
when
i
was
13
i
went
through
my
parents
texts
after
my
mom
left
her
phone
in
my
room
out
of
curiosity
i
found
this
exchange
which
ruined
my
life
forever
dad
i've
got
tiger
blood
really
sad
reference
to
the
charlie
sheen
episodes
mom
and
horse
semen
wtf
does
that
mean
dad
does
that
make
my
name
my
little
pony
dear
god
why
did
i
do
that
i
was
compared
to
a
my
little
pony
by
my
parents
at
what
point
does
the
bible
become
legitimate
i've
been
trying
to
read
the
bible
you
know
to
expand
my
horizons
and
it's
so
damn
hard
genesis
1
4
basically
state
that
evolution
didn't
happen
genesis
1
says
that
god
created
the
stars
which
technically
means
he
created
other
solar
systems
but
he
only
blessed
earth
and
decided
earth
was
good
is
genesis
just
a
joke
what
do
these
billions
of
people
read
that
makes
sense
to
them
i
mean
so
far
it's
kind
of
a
good
book
full
of
sex
and
murder
why
the
fuck
did
cain
kill
abel
some
bullshit

i
feel
weird
whenever
my
friends
make
remarks
such
as
we're
paying
"50,000"
tuition
and
you're
complaining
about
the
cost
of
that
i
have
100
financial
aid
and
i
do
have
trouble
affording
trivial
things
because
it
adds
up
so
i
refuse
going
to
parties
sometimes
i
don't
complain
for
the
sake
of
complaining
and
i'm
not
trying
to
whine
i'm
just
telling
the
truth
friend
what
are
you
gonna
be
for
halloween
me
drunk
so
my
gf
and
i
were
fooling
around
in
a
back
hallway
before
the
bell
rang
and
she
was
trying
to
suck
me
off
well
we
were
working
hard
but
i
couldn't
cum
and
the
bell
rang
didn't
want
to
be
caught
so
we
dashed
into
the
textbook
storage
room
to
finish
she
was
sucking
and
tugging
so
hard
i
could
swear
my
dick
was
about
to
pop
finally
i
cam
and
we
heard
the
tardy
bell
ring
so
i
zip
up
while
she
chews
some
gum
and
we
walk
into
our
first
period
history
together
we
get
sent
to
the
attendance
office
for
being
late
and
when
asked
why
i
mumbled
half
jokingly
came
late
to
that
the
attendance
lady
said
oh
the
bus
ok
and
gave
us
excused
absences
my
dick
was
red
and
throbbing
until
4th
period
best
friday
ever
whoop

find

people
with
conceal
carry
permits
stupid
especially
when
they
start
with
the
i
totally
could
have
used
my
gun
to
solve
this
completely
trivial
situation
but
i
didn't
because
i
know
how
to
control
myself
kind
of
crap

interested
in
starting
a
real
business

sometimes
i
just
want
to
slap
someone
in
the
face
and
when
he
asks
what
was
that
for
i'll
simply
say
it
doesn't
matter
it's
in
the
past
why
is
robert
mahaffie
not
on
campus
right
now
how
is
anything
even
getting
done
i
have
weird
sexual
fetishes
you
know
in
porn
how
they
shit
on
each
other
i
dig
that
shit
no
pun
intended
can
someone
please
organize
a
naked
run
through
olin
at
some
point
this
week
4253
to
the
asian
guy
with
the
thick
framed
glasses
i
saw
at
yates
on
wednesday
why
are
you
a
freshman
i
honesty
wish
i
could
just
slap
a
girl
in
my
mentor
group
in
the
face
she
is
literally
a
nymphomaniac
a
kleptomaniac
and
a
giant
racist
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
are
just
because
some
guys
pay
attention
to
you
because
you
are
easy
doesn't
mean
they
respect
you
open
your
eyes
no
one
likes
you
because
of
the
stupid
and
offensive
shit
you
say
it
is
your
own
damn
fault
you
have
no
friends
if
a
random
guy
takes
a
picture
of
a
girl
the
girl
will
think
that
is
weird
now
why
should
a
girl
be
able
to
take
a
picture
of
me
a
friend
told
me
that
a
short
fat
hispanic
girl
took
a
picture
of
me
and
then
uploaded
to
some
social
website
she
then
mentioned
that
she
loved
my
boots
and
then
some
other
fat
black
girl
commented
that
she
did
too
and
my
uniform
too
boot
chasers
these
days
but
if
a
guy
had
done
the
same
then
all
hell
would
break
lose
if
i
ever
see
this
girl
taking
a
picture
of
me
i
will
really
confront
her
and
ask
her
to
delete
it
howdy
everyone
you
might
not
be
familiar
with
texas
world
speedway
but
if
you
are
there's
a
scumbag
real
estate
mogul
out
there
who
wants
to
tear
it
down
to
build
another
cookie
cutter
development
in
its
place
tws
is
a
truly
historic
venue
and
hosts
1
8
mile
drag
racing
every
other
wednesday
night
when
daylight
savings
time
goes
away
to
give
us
more
light
in
addition
there's
a
full
infield
race
track
where
performance
driving
classes
are
hosted
it's
central
to
dallas
houston
and
austin
which
makes
it
real
easy
for
anyone
to
book
events
there
especially
since
there's
no
professional
racing
circuit
or
members
only
time
slots
to
work
around
whether
or
not
you've
ever
been
here
would
you
rather
have
a
year
round
fully
booked
race
track
or
another
development
with
some
offices
an
elementary
school
and
a
few
hundred
million
dollars
of
tax
money
going
to
develop
all
the
utility
infrastructure
for
it
by
the
way
there's
a
little
thing
called
tx2k
and
we
hosted
it
here
this

i
don't
know
how
i
feel
about
trigger
warnings
not
just
on
confessions
but
everything
i
understand
that
minimizing
harm
to
somebody
else's
mental
health
is
ideal
but
once
you
leave
cc
and
the
comfort
of
the
community
that
is
super
cautious
about
hurting
other
people's
feelings
the
real
world
knocks
the
wind
out
of
you
i
do
not
mean
to
sound
cynical
and
scary
and
dark
but
the
reality
is
that
the
world
outside
of
cc
can
be
mean
and
insensitive
and
triggering
in
every
way
you
can
imagine
maybe
its
not
intentional
but
you
will
hear
and
experience
things
that
will
bring
up
terrible
memories
insecurities
or
tendencies
i
understand
that
cc
tries
to
foster
a
healthy
environment
but
when
i
left
i
found
that
by
pushing
aside
my
problems
my
fears
my
disorders
for
4
years
i
was
only
hurting
myself
i'm
just
now
facing
them
head
on
for
the
first
time
and
its
so
difficult
to
do
when
you're
trying
to
financially
support
yourself
and
create
a
life
i'm
not
saying
we
should
all
be
cruel
to
one
another
and
post
terrible
things
just
so
students
will
develop
a
thicker
skin
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
cc
students
have
the
hard
conversations
about
the
hard
things
in
their
lives
while
they're
at
cc
utilize
that
supportive
community
not
as
a
blanket
to
hide
under
but
as
a
pillar
of
strength
to
face
your
issues
people
say
you
should
wait
until
you're
ready
but
what
if
you're
never
ready
when
else
are
you
going
to
live
in
as
wonderful
a
community
environment
as
cc
don't
wait
until
your
issues
come
to
you
because
when
they
do
you
won't
know
how
to
handle
the
triggers
and
it'll
be
so
much
harder
to
deal
with
alone
i
am
the
least
likely
guy
anyone
would
ever
expect
to
be
addicted
to
porn
but
i
was
addicted
to
it
in
a
crazy
crazy
crazy
way
since
i
was
about
fifteen
at
the
peak
of
my
addiction
i
watched
about
15
videos
a
day
and
jerk
off
every
single
time
before
class
once
i
got
home
but
most
importantly
right
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
would
cum
in
about
30
seconds
for
the
first
time
normally
already
having
switched
through
3
videos
watching
porn
was
habit
routine
normal
because
it
was
so
normal
i'm
not
entirely
sure
as
to
why
i
was
driven
to
do
it
but
i
think
it
was
driven
by
my
smaller
than
average
penis
size
and
a
complete
lack
of
self
esteem
having
been
bullied
all
through
elementary
and
middle
school
today
marks
the
day
where
i've
been
off
porn
for
a
whole
year
since
then
things
have
changed
a
lot
i
lost
my
virginity
last
semester
for
the
first
time
i
can
say
that
i
have
experienced
intimacy
in
a
relationship
i
pick
up
on
signals
so
so
much
better
i
have
realized
and
am
gradually
accepting
that
a
majority
of
women
actually
do
find
me
attractive
i've
become
much
more
sensitive
to
everyone's
emotions
and
all
my
relationships
have
become
that
much
better
my
self
confidence
in
all
aspects
of
my
life
has
increased
ridiculously
and
i
am
capable
of
doing
anything
it's
all
because

happy
valentine's
day
eve
boys
this
time
next
year
lets
go
and
make
some
ladies
happy
i
love
to
clean
my
ears
and
my
girlfriend's
ears
anyone
else
think
it's
satisfying
to
pull
out
a
chunk
of
ear
wax
hope
this
doesn't
make
me
a
weird
girl
damn
asian
habits
you
besmirched
my
honorable
name
and
accidentally
killed
my
hamster
what
more
do
you
want
from
me
198
i
am
a
girl
and
it's
pretty
depressing
to
read
all
these
confessions
from
guys
and
girls
about
sex
that
will
just
make
the
opposite
sex
disrespect
each
other
even
more
like
i
just
hook
up
with
them
because
they're
better
than
a
vibrator
i
understand
that
everyone
has
sexual
needs
but
not
every
guy
and
girl
out
there
is
an
emotionless
pig
who
wants
to
get
laid
help
senior
looking
for
the
easiest
class
to
take
pass
fail
next
block
while
i
start
thesis
research
need
the
ultimate
blowoff
any
suggestions
what
if
i
am
not
okay
i
don't
know
i
have
been
trying
to
ignore
my
depression
since
last
spring
i
may
not
have
lost
my
virginity
completely
but
i
have
hooked
more
times
and
with
more
people
than
i
ever
expected
to
all
the
hookups
were
planned
i
wanted
to
do
them
and
i
have
fun
of
course
as
with
any
hookup
the
fun
the
happiness
was
only
momentary
i
have
messed
with
so
many
guy's
heads
and
so
many
guys
have
messed
with
my
head
why
can't
anybody
say
what
they
mean
i
am
starting
to
lower
my
self
worth
i
honestly
find
nothing
wrong
with
people
hooking
up
but
i
did
it
for
the
wrong
reasons
i
did
it
because
i
was
depressed
and
alone
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
who
care
so
much
but
none
of
them
know
i
am
starting
to
feel
like
i
can't
be
in
a
real
relationship
because
i
am
so
insecure
that
act
weird
and
like
an
asshole
to
any
guy
i
actually
like
because
i
guess
i
know
how
much
it
could
hurt
with
someone
i
like
i
am
sorry
for
the
long
confession
i
just
needed
to
let
this
out
why
do
sorority
girls
think
they
are
soooo
pretty
i
ride
the
bus
that
goes
by
the
houses
and
the
majority
of
them
are
pretty
fugly
to
me
so
i
don't
understand
what
happened
we
were
together
for
years
you
were
by
my
side
for
all
the
shitty
relationships
i
went
through
and
i
was
there
for
yours
i
don't
know
why
it
took
me
until
we
were
both
17
to
make
the
best
decision
of
my
life
to
ask
my
best
friend
to
be
something
more
you
were
funny
always
a
joy
to
be
around
your
outgoing
behavior
and
awesome
personality
always
put
a
smile
on
my
face
beautiful
in
every
way
you
told
me
i
said
that
too
much
but
i
felt
i
couldn't
say
it
enough
you
were
smart
charming
athletic
and
sweet
the
first
time
i
heard
you
curse
several
months
into
our
relationship
those
are
memories
it
hurts
to
think
about
now
i
mean
when
i
think
about
it
thing
were
just
about
perfect
between
us
we
never
really
had
a
legitimate
fight
in
the
years
we
spent
together
so
why
did
i
have
to
be
so
dumb
i
thought
a
long
distance
relationship
would
hurt
us
that's
what
i
was
told
anyway
i
went
to
a
m
while
you
stayed
and
went
to
a
local
college
i
thought
it
would
be
better
if
we
retained
our
friendship
by
letting
our
love
lives
go
i
didn't
want
to
see
you
hurt
that
was
all
i
texted
infrequently
but
tried
not
to
make
it
daily
as
i
did
not
want
you
to
become
too
attached
while
gone
in
reality
i
too
was
afraid
of
being
the
pain
associated
with
keeping
in
touch
with
someone
i
loved
but
would
not
be
able
to
see
in
person
except
once
every
2
or
3
months
originally
i
thought
i
would
propose
yes
it
seems
dumb
as
we
only
dated
a
year
and
a
half
but
this
way
i
could
keep
you
with
me
forever
you
legitimately
made
me
happy
a
rare
feeling
for
me
and
all
i
wanted
was
to
be
the
same
to
you
yet
at
the
same
time
it
didn't
seem
the
right
thing
to
do
for
a
number
of
reasons
so
in
the
end
i
simply
came
here
it
took
me
a
solid
week
before
i
called
but
you
have
to
believe
i
wanted
to
do
it
every
single
day
you
seemed
so
happy
when
you
heard
from
me
that
it
actually
hurt
me
despair
followed
which
made
me
message
you
less
and
less
knowing
that
you
may
be
just
as
hurt
as
i
was
by
this
schism
between
us
and
as
i
had
always
told
you
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
hurt
you
we
finally
started
slowly
sinking
back
to
the
friends
only
routine
sending
funny
pics
complaining
about
tests
and
whatever
else
college
was
like
the
same
as
we
used
to
do
all
the
time
except
without
the
i
love
you's
everywhere
it
wasn't
daily
or
anything
it
was
frequent
though
not
a
day
went
by
that
i
did
not
think
of
you
though
then
i
finally
mentioned
in
november
that
i
would
be
heading
home
for
the
first
time
for
christmas
break
and
you
were
so
excited
you
were
the
one
who
said
that
we
should
go
eat
lunch
together
just
to
catch
up
so
what
happened
why
do
you
hate
me
due
to
finals
about
a
week
went
by
that
i
didn't
get
a
hold
of
you
and
i
figured
for
the
same
reasons
you
didn't
contact
me
either
but
as
soon
as
i
returned
home
i
couldn't
get
a
hold
of
you
a
few
days
passed
and
i
stopped
calling
and
simply
texted
asking
about
our
lunch
plans
that's
when
you
told
me
you
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
me
you
told
me
to
stay
out
of
your
life
that
i
needed
to
just
accept
that
we
were
nothing
and
to
move
on
i
know
i
screwed
up
by
leaving
you
i
never
really
said
it
but
we
both
knew
it
was
happening
when
i
left
that
was
the
worst
mistake
i've
made
in
my
college
career
but
i
still
don't
understand
i
let
it
drop
for
a
month
i
figured
something
may
have
been
going
on
within
your
family
or
perhaps
just
a
bad
round
of
finals
but
when
i
finally
got
a
hold
of
you
again
late
january
you
shut
me
out
you
told
me
never
to
talk
to
you
again
out
of
the
blue
no
explanation
no
anything
you
just
said
you've
moved
on
and
it's
time
for
me
to
as
well
there
never
was
any
closure
and
for
some
reason
i
never
got
over
you
i
was
told
time
heals
all
wounds
but
it's
been
a
couple
years
now
and
i
still
t
my
boyfriend
wants
to
have
sex
with
me
he
is
calling
me
to
his
place
he
has
a
dog
though
and
he
will
be
there
in
the
room
while
we
would
be
making
out
i'm
scared
what
if
he
barks
bites
or
licks
here
and
there
i'd
be
naked
frankly
i
have
been
denying
his
offer
coz
of
that
dog
any
girl
here
who
had
sex
with
their
boyfriend
with
the
dog
in
the
same
room

this
is
a
message
to
every
single
girl
who
has
written
on
this
page
hating
their
bodies
because
of
someone
else's
reaction
i
am
a
20
year
old
girl
i
am
5'4
and
i
weigh
135
pounds
i
am
not
a
size
zero
and
by
high
fashion
standards
i
am
fat
well
i
can
run
a
5k
in
about
21
minutes
and
i
can
leg
press
almost
100
pounds
on
each
side
i
am
proud
of
the
way
i
look
i
consistently
receive
compliments
on
my
body
even
though
you
can't
exactly
see
my
rib
cage
and
i
don't
have
sticks
for
legs
i
had
times
in
my
life
when
i
weighed
much
more
and
hated
my
body
but
my
current
boyfriend
loved
me
and
supported
me
at
every
weight
i
asked
him
one
morning
why
he
loved
the
way
i
looked
even
though
i
hated
it
and
he
responded
simply
i
like
women
not
models
how
are
we
supposed
to
grow
old
together
if
you
spend
your
20s
starving
yourself
girls
there
are
men
and
women
who
will
love
you
even
if
there
is
a
little
extra
to
love
and
will
be
your
rock
rather
than
the
anchor
weighing
you
down
this
is
no
longer
the
era
where
girls
should
aspire
to
look
like
hangers
wearing
clothes
or
skeletons
with
skin
aspire
to
run
faster
swim
farther
and
be
in
shape
regardless
of
how
much
you
weigh
or
what
your
size
is
be
athletic
have
a
booty
love
your
hips
find
a
guy
or
girl
who
will
lift
you
up
while
you
get
your
weight
down
rather
than
use
your
fears
against
you
i
might
die
never
having
fit
into
a
size
zero
or
one
but
i
will
live
long
enough
to
bear
children
and
have
the
energy
to
teach
them
how
to
play
soccer
or
swim
because
i
am
healthy
i
am
athletic
i
have
a
booty
i
am
a
woman
and
my
man
has
loved
me
always
you
won't
find
better
until
you
recognize
you
deserve
better
so
stop
being
girls
stand
up
and
be
women
more
or
less

up
my
life
right
now

made

is

you're

how
it
is
right
ladies
you
know
a
guy
for
a
while
you
hang
out
with
him
you
do
fun
things
with
himplay
video
games
watch
movies
go
hiking
go
to
concerts
you
invite
him
to
your
parties
you
listen
to
his
problems
you
do
all
this
because
you
think
he
wants
to
be
your
friend
but
then
then
comes
the
fateful
moment
where
you
find
out
that
all
this
time
hes
only
seen
you
as
a
potential
girlfriend
and
then
if
you
turn
him
down
he
may
never
speak
to
you
again
this
has
happened
to
me
time
after
time
i
hit
it
off
with
a
guy
and
for
all
that
ive
been
burned
in
the
past
i
start
to
think
that
this
one
might
actually
care
about
me
as
a
person
and
then
he
asks
me
on
a
date
i
tell
him
how
much
i
enjoy
his
company
how
much
i
value
his
friendship
i
tell
him
that
i
really
want
to
be
his
friend
and
to
continue
hanging
out
with
him
and
talking
about
our
favorite
books
or
exploring
new
restaurants
or
making
fun
of
avant
garde
theatre
productions
but
he
rejects
me
he
doesnt
answer
my
calls
or
e
mails
if
wed
been
making
plans
to
do
something
before
this
fateful
incident
these
plans
mysteriously
fail
to
materialize
this
is
why
i
never
did
get
around
to
seeing
the
hunger
games
movie
not
to
name
any
names
but
thanks
a
lot
tom
later
when
i
run
into
him
at
social
events
our
conversations
are
awkward
and
lukewarm
this
is
because
the
moment
we
met
he
put
me
in
the
girlfriend
zone
and
now
he
cant
see
me
as
friend
material
i
must
say
that
i
find
this
really
unfair
i
mean
im
a
nice
girl
i
have
a
lot
to
offer
as
a
friend
like
not
being
a
douchebag
and
stuff
but
males
just
dont
want
to
be
friends
with
nice
girls
like
me
they
cant
help
it
i
guess
its
just
how
theyre
wired
biologically
evolution
conditioned
our
male
hominid
ancestors
to
seek
nice
girls
as
mates
and
form
friendship
bonds
only
with
the
other
dudes
that
they
hunted
mammoths
with
its
truei
know
this
because
i
studied
hominids
in
my
fifth
grade
science
class
so
whats
the
answer
should
i
take
up
mammoth
hunting
in
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
friendship
centers
of
mens
primal
lizardbrains
should
i
keep
making
guy
friends
and
then
prevent
them
from
making
a
move
on
me
by
subtly
undermining
their
self
confidence
should
i
just
give
up
on
those
manipulative
game
playing
two
faced
bastards
once
and
for
all
i
dont
know
i
mean
id
really
like
to
have
a
true
friendship
with
a
guy
someday
but
its
so
hard
to
trust
and
respect
them
when
they
never
say
what
they
meanand
you
never
know
when
you
might
be
relegated
to
the
girlfriend
zone
what
the
hell's
a
univasity
makes
me
glad
i
don't
go
to
alabama

my
best
friend
has
been
talking
about
graduating
early
for
awhile
but
the
realization
that
this
possibilty
could
become
a
reality
is
only
just
starting
to
sink
in
i
say
that
i'll
get
over
it
i'll
understand
and
maybe
in
time
i
will
but
right
now
i
just
feel
lost
i
don't
understand
nor
will
i
ever
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
cut
their
time
at
cornell
short
how
could
willingly
i
miss
out
on
my
last
semester
of
college
but
for
me
the
real
question
is
this
how
can
i
be
expected
to
spend
my
last
semester
of
college
without
the
one
person
who
has
been
there
for
me
through
it
all
when
i
was
little
my
mom
had
schizophrenia
and
she
was
unable
to
take
care
of
me
during
my
entire
childhood
i
felt
so
bad
for
her
because
she
had
a
really
hard
time
with
everything
and
she
didn't
even
know
she
had
it
until
she
was
diagnosed
later
on
in
her
life
her
psychiatrist
was
shitty
must
explain
why
texas
is
50th
in
the
us
when
it
comes
to
mental
health
care
anyways
i
had
vowed
to
major
in
psychology
and
go
to
med
school
and
become
a
psychiatrist
and
give
my
all
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
have
a
career
unfortunately
i
majored
in
chemistry
instead
and
am
a
graduate
student
but
i
cannot
stop
thinking
about
how
i
should've
majored
in
psychology
honestly
i'm
really
unhappy
with
my
choice
is
it
too
late
to
go
back
and
major
in
what
i
want
or
should
i
suck
it
up
and
stick
to
what
i've
already
achieved
has
anyone
ever
heard
of
bitcoins
just
trying
to
judge
how
many
have
heard
invest
in
this
or
other
cryptocurrencies
i
am
the
only
one
who
thinks
it
inappropriate
to
discuss
your
grades
publicly
after
never
getting
stood
up
in
my
life
i've
been
stood
up
twice
in
one
week

a
good
friend
sent
me
this
do
you
ever
get
mad
at
yourself
or
like
just
frustrated
that
you
keep
doing
stuff
or
trying
too
hard
for
certain
people
like
you
do
it
because
it's
who
you
are
but
it's
such
a
waste
of
effort
you
get
mad
at
yourself
for
wasting
time
and
effort
but
then
you
just
keep
doing
it
this
is
exactly
how
i
feel
i
just
wish
i
could
be
a
bit
more
cold
hearted
or
at
least
find
people
who
will
appreciate
what
i
would
can
do
for
them

i
was
in
the
toilet
at
a
bar
with
my
pants
down
when
a
girl
i'm
a
girl
too
suddenly
opened
the
door
i
think
i
quickly
closed
it
back
but
i
was
really
drunk
and
don't
remember
too
well
now
i'm
really
worried
about
it
what
if
someone
took
a
picture
or
something
consolations
anyone

i
love
how
involved
cornell
students
are
in
their
studies
clubs
projects
etc
however
when
it
comes
to
local
national
politics
there
appears
to
be
lots
of
apathy
i
mean
you
hear
about
students
winning
awards
for
building
homes
in
africa
or
curing
aids
and
that's
great
and
all
but
what
about
at
home
why
is
no
one
fighting
that
the
average
collegetown
rent
is
over
800
while
the
houses
get
worse
every
year
and
more
stores
are
vacant
a
recent
cornell
grad
ran
for
congress
this
year
and
no
one
seemed
to
care
besides
the
few
politically
connected
students
aren't
these
things
that
every
cornellian
should
be
trying
to
promote
girls
don't
poop
or
fart
to
the
row
of
nothing
but
girls
in
my
american
literature
class
i
knew
one
of
you
fart
it
multiple
times
i
know
i
think
i
have
an
eating
disorder
i
just
want
to
eat
all
the
time
regardless
of
whether
or
not
i'm
hungry
this
has
been
a
big
problem
for
me
since
i
left
home
last
year
for
example
i'll
sit
in
my
room
eating
peanut
butter
until
i
realize
i've
downed
like
half
the
jar
which
is
a
whole
day's
worth
of
fat
and
then
i
feel
physically
awful
for
like
6
hours
and
to
all
who
think
that
this
is
just
stupid
and
i
should
stop
eating
so
much
that's
the
problem
i
know
that
i
can
do
better
but
what
makes
me
think
i
need
help
is
that
i
don't
do
better
some
days
i
eat
like
a
normal
person
but
i
would
say
like
every
other
day
i
have
a
meal
where
i
eat
wayyy
too
much
i
eat
until
i'm
full
then
i
eat
until
it
hurts
and
then
i
sometimes
eat
more
the
guilt
that
comes
with
it
is
a
huge
part
of
the
problem
i
know
the
biggest
issue
here
is
self
control
and
that
sometimes
i
exercise
it
well
so
i
get
really
down
on
myself
after
i've
eaten
horribly
because
i
know
it
was
in
my
power
to
do
differently
it
feels
good
to
admit
that
in
a
public
space
but
i
know
that
i
need
more
i
need
help
who
do
i
talk
to
about
this
what
resources
are
out
there
for
me

what's

i
didn't
want
her
to
spend
the
night
because
i
had
to
fart
so
i
bluntly
asked
her
if
we
were
going
to
have
sex
she
said
no
is
that
all
you
want
with
me
i
then
asked
her
to
leave
how
many
people
out
there
take
12

my
grandpa
was
a
die
hard
st
louis
cardinals
fan
he's
from
wisconsin
but
growing
up
on
the
farm
the
cardinals
games
were
the
only
one
his
radio
would
pick
up
he
suffered
with
several
ailments
for
many
years
including
parkinson
disease
and
died
when
i
was
in
middle
school
as
soon
as
he
did
a
family
of
cardinals
moved
into
my
grandma's
back
yard
coincidence
here
on
campus
i
volunteer
at
a
lab
researching
the
affects
of
parkinsons
today
after
having
spent
all
afternoon
finishing
up
a
project
for
the
lab
i
saw
a
beautiful
bright
red
cardinal
perched
in
a
tree
outside
vanhise
as
soon
as
i
left
msc
i
think
someone
is
likes
what
his
granddaughter
is
up
to
here
at
uw
madison
just
one
of
the

miracles
here
on

lbtq
community
stop
pushing
your
agenda
onto
everything
please
stop
it's
rather
getting
annoying
i'm
sure
most
you
can
look
up
or
already
know
the
history
about
st
patrick
and
how
march
17
is
set
aside
as
a
christian
feast
day
to
honor
him
nowadays
it
has
changed
into
another
event
to
get
together
and
drink
haha
not
arguing
with
this
st
paddy's
day
is
about
celebrating
your
irish
heritage
and
doing
irish
things
not
everything
under
the
sun
has
to
have
your
type
of
representation
if
you
want
to
join
in
on
the
festivities
and
celebrate
st
paddy's
day
with
us
i
won't
have
any
complaints
i'll
even
buy
you
a
pint
you
know
spread
the
joy
around
and
celebrate
now
don't
get
me
wrong
everyone
deserves
to
have
equal
representation
and
movements
to
gain
support
but
when
you
start
mixing
events
together
they
no
longer
become
distinct
and
or
important
it's
like
that
old
saying
don't
put
licorice
in
your
hamburger
alright
here's
something
i'll
make
a
promise
to
the
lbtq
community
i
will
stop
complaining
about
your
representations
in
public
when
you
equally
affect
all
non
exclusive
white
ethnic
events
such
as

sorry
the
ones
i
did
read
about
seemed
interesting
though
when
you
do
this
i'll
shut
up
until
then
i
will
be
a
strategic
opponent
to
your
leftist
crusade
to
destroy

also
if
you

it

they

tell

i'm

i

am

don't

material
for

is
anybody
looking

i
have
hit
breaking
point
with
my
roommate
he's
so
dull
rude
and
we
have
nothing
in

it's

i
know
there
are
a
ton
of
religious
people
that
go
here
but
does
that
mean
that
during
silver
taps
we
should
say
a
prayer
to
god
ending
in
amen
we
don't
go
to
a
religious
school
like
baylor
so
how
hard
is
it
to
just
have
a
moment
of
silence
or
even
a
silent
prayer
for
our
fallen
comrades
don't
get
me
wrong
i
love
silver
taps
i
just
think
that
in
a
school
that
talks
about
supporting
all
beliefs
we
don't
necessarily
do
howdy
i
have
a
question
and
i
hope
somebody
can
help
me
out
here
let's
say
a
student
wants
to
transfer
from
a
good
school
to
another
one
due
to
financial
problems
would
financial
problem
be
a
good
reason
to
write
on
the
college
transfer
essay
if
not
what
would
be
a
better
reason
thanks

how
do
you
move
on
from
someone
who
will
never
like
you
romantically
i
have
a
huge
crush
on
my
best
guy
friend
last
year
i
realized
that
he
didn't
return
my
feelings
and
that
there
was
very
little
chance
he
ever
would
so
i
stashed
away
my
feelings
and
banished
all
hope
but
recently
i
thought
he
started
liking
me
something
in
when
he
lent
me
something
really
important
to
him
without
telling
me
and
the
way
he
smiled
when
he
looked
at
me
i
kind
of
overreacted
to
that
and
now
i'm
pretty
sure
he
only
sees
me
as
a
friend
of
some
degree
of
importance
he's
brilliant
unique
to
the
point
of
eccentricity
stupidly
endearing
makes
a
shitton
of
money
while
barely
into
his
twenties
the
only
one
who
drives
me
completely
crazy
while
still
putting
a
smile
on
my
face
he's
the
one
i
can
always
count
on
for
advice
who
lets
me
feel
at
peace
in
his
presence
and
accepts
me
for
all
that
i
am
a
few
guys
caught
my
interest
since
the
initial
rejection
but
trying
to
flirt
with
them
fell
through
and
now
i'm
just
scared
that
i
won't
find
a
guy
at
all
ever
common
sense
tells
me
that
that
sentiment
is
just
stupid
but
but
more
than
that
i
put
up
a
face
of
toughness
to
hide
how
insecure
i
am
inside
how
do
i
know
a
guy
won't
fall
for
the
tough
me
and
throw
me
away
if
he
decides
i'm
a
burden
i'm
not
even
sure
i
want
a
guy
anymore
it's
just
too
hard
to
show
my
true
self
to
others

honest
question
why
are
black
men
so
into
dating
mixed
or
non
black
women
it's
fine
if
love
is
involved
but
i'm
noticing
that
it's
been
turning
into
a
trend
lately

im
so
shy
i
cant
ask
anyone
in

library
to
open
my

bottle
for

cancer
is

i
don't
like
relay
for
life
what
does
it
say
about
our
view
of
humanity
when
we
rally
the
campus
for
chronic
disease
while
we
do
next
to
nothing
about
truly
horrific
human

and
extreme
poverty
none
of
us
actually
care
about

this
might
be
long
but
i
swear
it's
worth
it
so
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
getting
fed
up
with
class
and
decided
to
let
out
some
steam
by
going
out
on
college
ave
and
hitting
up
some
house
parties
i
met
up
with
some
chicks
from
my
floor
and
started
pre
gaming
a
beer
and
two
shots
later
we
took
to
college
ave
we
got
to
the
bus
stop
outside
the
suites
and
waited
for
the
h
as
we
were
waiting
the
girls
were
starting
to
feel
it
and
were
getting
restless
eventually
we
got
on
the
bus
and
made
our
way
over
as
we
hit
each
bus
stop
more
and
more
people
kept
coming
on
the
bus
as
usual
on
a
friday
night
eventually
it
got
so
packed
that
i
had
this
girl
let's
call
her
sara
with
her
ass
right
in
my
junk
oh
my
god
was
it
glorious
every
time
the
bus
would
turn
or
hit
a
bump
she
would
take
it
as
an
excuse
to
rub
her
ass
more
and
more
into
me
this
fucking
tease
god
damn
i
had
to
try
so
hard
not
to
screw
this
up
when
the
bus
finally
stopped
at
the
rsc
and
she
started
to
leave
she
turned
to
me
and
gave
me
the
sneakiest
bitchiest
smile
the
fucking
bitch
enjoyed
it
cunt
and
off
into
the
night
she
went
when
we
got
off
the
bus
i
collected
my
girls
and
we
made
our
way
over
to
the
first
house
of
the
night
we
got
there
and
lo
and
behold
our
ratio
got
us
in
five
girls
to
one
guy
is
awesome
even
if
they
aren't
the
best
anyway
we
get
into
this
shitty
basement
and
no
one
is
there
yet
the
dj
is
at
his
table
and
really
killing
it
though
i
made
my
way
over
to
the
keg
and
poured
my
ladies
some
drinks
slowly
but
surely
the
party
started
to
fill
up
and
a
half
hour
later
the
place
was
roaring
make
outs
on
the
walls
sex
in
the
bathroom
shit
was
heating
up
i'm
moving
my
way
through
the
party
and
all
of
a
sudden
boom
sara
appears
out
of
nowhere
i
came
up
behind
this
bombshell
and
we
started
dancing
she
was
grinding
so
much
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
get
hard
at
this
point
she
hasn't
seen
my
face
she's
just
dancing
like
a
regular
thing
and
then
she
saw
my
face
and
she
smiled
that
bitch
smiled
and
she
only
started
to
tease
me
more
things
slowly
started
to
heat
up
and
then
we
started
kissing
softly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
as
each
minute
passed
eventually
she
pulled
me
close
and
said
let's
get
out
of
here
i
followed
her
upstairs
and
we
wound
up
in
some
kid's
bedroom
she
slowly
started
to
undress
her
top
first
and
then
she
came
to
me
grabbing
my
belt
she
whispered
to
me
baby
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
best
time
you've
ever
had
trying
to
be
smooth
i
whispered
back
oh
yeah
and
what
can
i
give
you
she
responded
with
about
tree
fiddy
god
damn
it
it
was
then
i
realized
that
sara
was
an
8
story
monster
from
the
paleozoic
era
i
said
god
damn
it
i
ain't
given
you
no
three
fifty
you
god
damn
lochness
monster
i
slapped
that
bitch
and
left
why
can't
the
tamu
wifi
ever
stay
connected
longer
than
5
minutes
at
a
time
all
i
want
is
to
get
some
homework
done
in
my
dorm
2190
a
friend
of
mine
tonight
explained
his
reasoning
to
why
illegal
immigrants
are
worthless
people
and
it
made
me
so
angry
because
i
can
only
imagine
how
hard
some
people
work
at
making
their
lives
better
or
their
children's
lives
filled
with
more
opportunity
he
brought
it
down
to
a
basic
principal
which
was
the
idea
that
it
was
illegal
for
them
to
be
here
yet
he
illegally
brought
me
over
a
bottle
of
wine
so
shouldn't
he
be
punished
too
i
don't
want
my
tuition
money
to
pay
for
these
extravagant
and
unnecessary
expenses
the
money
should
go
to
more
scholarships
and
aid
to
students

at

particularly

etc
suddenshit
seriously
won't
do
jack

about
it
and
i
really
wish
i
could
sue
them
for
not
delivering
on
the
promised
internet
speeds
i'm
paying
for
does
it
cost
to
take
a
half
block

i
just
want
a
nice
geeky
catholic
boy
who
can
do
complex
calculus
quote
every
line
from
big
bang
theory
and
will
make
a
lot
of
money
from
computers
one
day
is
that
so
much
to
ask
for
10641
before
coming
here
i
loved
the
shape
of
my
body
i
am
kind
of
pear
shaped
but
i
loved
my
small
waist
full
hips
big
butt
and
thick
thighs
but
ever
since
i
got
here
i
don't
feel
like
guys
are
attracted
to
me
anymore
i
never
get
longing
looks
or
cat
calls
anymore
i
think
im
cute
and
sexy
whats
wrong
is
it
because
im
not
a
twig
like
the
rest
of
these
girls
please
be
honest
what
do
u
call
it
when
there
is
a
fire
at
the
tea
haus
and
all
the
fancy
teas
escape
but
there's
one
tea
who
was
always
a
little
bit
different
than
the
rest
and
he
doesnt
quite
realize
what
was
going
on
and
doesnt
make
it
out
in
time
what's

secret

unh
dining
again
on
the
unh
dining
topic
there
should
be
a
tiered
dining
plan
offered
where
the
first
50
swipes
cost
like
i
don't
knoww
9
the
next
50
swipes
cost
8
each
the
next
50
cost
7
each
and
so
on
this
would
make
it
so
that
you
would
be
counting
up
instead
of
counting
down
and
possibly
wasting
swipes
if
the
cost
of
dining
diminished
the
more
you
went
then
you
would
probably
be
more
likely
to
justify
it
to
yourself
to
go
over
into
that
next
tier
this
way
the
university
is
making
more
money
than
they
would
had
you
stopped
once
you
ran
out
plus
it
costs
that
much
less
and
it
is
easier
to
justify
to
yourself
to
go
and
best
of
all
you
don't
need
to
buy
a
bunch
of
swipes
when
you
run
out
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
p.s
is
it
bad
that
i
post
my
good
ideas
here
because
if
i
posted
them
under
my
name
people
wouldn't
take
them
seriously
4455
i
can't
stand
all
the
jews
in
my
pog
class
shouldn't
they
be
taking
more
accounting
classes
14342
i
think
it's
funny
that
someone
who
makes
false
and
exaggerated
rumors
about
you
and
your
friends
try
and
suck
up
to
you
are
you
kidding
me
you
two
faced
creep
and
i
don't
even
know
you
how
dare
you
spread
crap
that's
not
even
true
girls
at
cc
are
a
little
too
skinny
for
my
preference
not
that
yall
look
bad
it's
just
a
personal
turn
on
for
me
when
girls
are
a
little
thicker
but
not
large
like
a
size
6
or
8
with
some
nice
curves
is
that
so
much
to
ask
for
1914
so
i
know
black
people
have
sex
to
music
like
r
kelly
trey
songz
jodeci
etc
but
what
kind
of
music
do
white
people
have
sex
to
question
for
all
guys
what
do
you
consider
a
fat
girl
4976
i
just
looked
back
to
the
first
few
nyu
secrets
and
i
am
actually
stunned
at
how
amazing
and
high
quality
they
are
honest
secrets
where
people
share
something
deep
and
personal
a
vent
to
lift
things
off
their
shoulders
and
communal
acceptance
which
i'm
sure
was
the
reason
for
the
creation
of
this
page
why
now
almost
5000
secrets
later
is
it
so
different
either
the
op's
taste
in
secrets
are
different
i
have
submitted
several
good
and
personal
ones
and
not
one
had
been
posted
or
he
is
receiving
so
many
that
the
ones
who
really
want
need
their
secret
shared
and
support
viewed
are
buried
under
stupidity
like
4969
so
guess
what
guys
today
nyu
was
supposed
to
post
class
listings
for
fall
2014
wanna
guess
what
today
is
lacking
secret
number
4968
was
a
beautiful
one
and
gave
me
hope
for
a
change
in
the
attitude
here
more
support
and
better
quality
secrets
cheers
to
the
big
5000
and
perhaps
my
past
secrets
getting

you

make

that's

don't

if
its

the
fact
that
nyu
is
having
ally
week
next
week
seriously
pisses
me
off
this
is
basically
like
having
white
history
month
it's
essentially
saying
good
job
not
being
a
member
of
the
westboro
baptist
church
now
here's
an
entire
week
commemorating
all
the
hard
work
it
takes
you
to
practice
the
most
basic
level
of
human
decency
it's
fucking
ridiculous
where
is
gay
bisexual
week
pansexual
week
trans
week
asexual
week
or
any
week
in
support
of
any
sexual
minority
those
are
the
people
that
need
the
recognition
not
a
bunch
of
straight
people
who
call
themselves
gay
rights
advocates
because
they
watch
modern
family
and
know
the
chorus
to
that
one
song
by
macklemore
discrimination
and
violence
happen
constantly
to
members
of
the
lgbtqa
community
yet
here
we
are
dedicating
a
whole
week
to
the
recognition
of
a
group
of
people
who
have
never
faced
that
kind
of
oppression
you
don't
get
a
prize
just
for
not
being
a
bigoted
asshole

i
see
derek
wang
is
back
on
campus
againbut
why
does
he
still
not
like
white
girls
so
this
is
going
to
sound
a
bit
weird
but
i'm
assuming
st
mary's
is
somewhat
catholic
if
so
i
need
mass
times
and
if
not
then
what
is
a
church
in
cstat
that
is
catholic
y
and
what
are
it's
mass
times
also
please
let
me
know
which
mass
time
has
not
that
many
college
y
kids
parents
are
wanting
to
visit
and
go
to
mass
i
will
eventually
tell
them
i'm
atheist
after
they
are
done
paying
for
school
instead
of
writing
about
what
kind
of
relationship
or
person
you
want
as
a
significant
other
why
don't
you
go
make
a
dating
page
where
you
won't
be
anonymous
and
people
can
tell
you
if
they
are
interested
instead
of
validating
whether
your
standards
are
too
or
too
low
because
some
of
those
posts
are
cute
and
can
agree
with
you
but
i
don't
know
who
to
contact
to
tell
them
i'm
interested
caa
aaaaaaaan
anybodyyyyyyyyyy

i
never

remember
when
we
met
at

and
i
said
that
really
cheesy
pick
up
line
where
i
inadvertently
asked
for
your
number
i
am
so
upset
that
i
didn't
actually
take
it
when
you
offered
it
i
wonder
if
things
would
have
been
different
if
i
actually
wrote
it
down
i
am
so
stupid
i
was
so
embarrassed
that
i
pretended
to
not
need
your
number
but
i
really
liked
you
and
i
still
like
you

anything
to

when
some

liked

got

i
was
ecstatic

came
the

though
probably
inconsequential
in
the

things
for

was
intrinsic

of

nyu

shared

a

that

it

all
is
humbling
i
have
some
ideas
and
plans
for
how
to
make
the
next
year
of
nyu
secrets
a
year
of
growth
not
just
in
numbers
but
beyond
this
facebook
page
i've
been
in
contact
with
several
people
and
if
things
work
out
i
believe
that
nyu
secrets
can
become
something
much
larger
than
i
ever
imagined
on
this
day
last
year
thank
you
all
we've
laughed
we've
cried
we've
procrastinated
endlessly
we've
pissed
each
other
off
most
importantly
though
we've
proven
to
everyone
the
school
and
to
ourselves
that
we
here
at
nyu
have
a
little
something
people
like
to
call
community
happy
birthday
nyus
i'm
tirred
of
meeting
douch
bags
on
northgate
where
can
i
meet
a
good
guy
who
is
fun
smart
tall
and
sweet
1447
trigger
warning
disordered
eating
i
had
a
dream
i
was
flirting
with
leonardo
dicaprio
and
i
said
what's
your
sign
and
he
said
dicapricorn
and
i
laughed
so
hard
i
woke
myself
up
for
all
the
people
complaining
about
getting
kicked
out
of
parties
you
know
that
at
most
state
schools
you
can't
get
into
house
parties
unless
you
know
the
people
that
live
there
open
parties
like
the
kind
at
cc
are
pretty
uncommon
mohio
i
am
replying
and
have
to
say
i
am
looking
for
more
than
a
hard
dick
and
a
smile
i
should
also
say
i
am
clearly
not
like
the
girls
you
dance
with
so
maybe
i
shouldn't
be
giving
you
advice
on
this
i
definitely
do
not
walk
away
from
dancing
if
a
guy
talks
to
me
it
seems
kind
of
rude
to
me
holding
hands
is
cute
kinda
romantic
you
go
in
for
the
kiss
before
you
have
even
talked
that
is
ballsy
though
that
more
than
likely
would
be
something
i
walk
away
from
makes
it
obvious
what
you
are
looking
for
i
would
dance
that
way
with
a
boyfriend
guy
i
am
dating
or
a
guy
that
interests
me
with
his
words
first
but
not
a
guy
who
doesn't
talk
to
me
whispering
in
my
ear
is
extra
sexy
though
not
so
sure
if
you
are
my
type
in
that
since
but
maybe
i'll
see
at
club
someday
and
find
out
p
mari
gades
i
saw
your
picture
when
i
was
trolling
the
comments
of
cc
confessions
yes
i'm
a
goon
and
i
gotta
say
you
are
unbelievably
beautiful
so
we
should
do
activities
sometime
maybe
go
to
a
place
and
perhaps
do
some
stuff
this
summer
all
i
want
to
do
is
train
hop
across
america
but
everyone
i
ask
to
come
along
looks
at
me
like
i'm
crazy
is
there
anyone
at
tamu
with
as
bad
of
a
case
of
wanderlust
as
me
11876
re
11839
am
i
the
only
one
who
has
noticed
that
my
gaydar
is
obviously
off
ftfy
not
sure
if
troll
but
people
are
generally
not
gay
or
gay
except
straight
for
black
women
just
because
you
think
so
that's
kind
of
offensive
in
more
than
one
way
every
time
i
hook
up
with
a
guy
i
make
it
seem
like
i
accidentally
left
with
their
shirt
shorts
on
still
and
i'll
give
it
back
in
reality
i
have
zero
intention
of
ever
returning
it
it
never
happened
if
you
don't
have
an
article
of
clothing
to
prove
it
right
am
i
the
only
dude
who
masturbates
more
than
2x
a
day
i'm
an
incoming
freshman
worried
about
the
freshman

hey
sex
burns
calories

i
think
people
need
to
re
evaluate
how
they
think
about
mental
illness
people
are
born
with
a
set
of
traits
and
for
some
reason
when
some
one
has
a
small
fault
like
say
they're
really
slow
at
reading
we
call
them
slow
or
even
stupid
but
when
you
put
a
name
on
it
like
add
the
person
is
no
longer
stupid
because
their
disability
isn't
his
her
fault
similarly
if
someone
hits
your
car
and
says
they
were
drunk
or
fell
asleep
at
the
wheel
we're
all
pissed
off
but
if
they
say
i
have
a
mental
illness
or
i
have
a
mental
illness
that
made
me
an
alcoholic
so
i
drove
drunk
we
are
all
of
a
sudden
supposed
to
feel
sympathetic
because
it's
not
his
her
fault
whether
you
side
with
nature
or
nurture
most
of
your
traits
are
fairly
out
of
your
control
if
you
categorize
stupidity
as
someone
who
is
slow
to
understand
things
or
has
a
bad
memory
or
doesn't
have
much
information
or
is
just
ignorant
then
yes
people
with
mental
disabilities
are
the
most
stupid
people
they
are
in
fact
in
a
special
category
for
it
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
call
anyone
stupid
then
why
would
you
say
he's
not
stupid
he
just
has
add
or
he's
not
a
criminal
he's
just
bipolar
it
doesn't
make
sense.we
have
to
realize
that
the
only
difference
between
someone
who
commits
a
crime
with
no
good
excuse
and
someone
who
commits
a
crime
and
blames
it
on
his
her
mental
illness
is
that
one
had
the
money
to
go
get
diagnosed
and
the
other
didn't
i'm
feeling
so
blah
right
now
i
know
there's
no
reason
for
me
to
be
upset
but
there's
no
reason
for
me
to
feel
happy
how
do
i
get
over
this
literally
all
my
wildest
dreams
have
come
true
this
summer
from
incredible
travels
to
great
jobs
spending
time
with
my
family
and
hooking
up
with
with
my
childhood
crush
i've
had
my
eye
on
for
10
years
it
seems
like
i
just
can't
lose
recently
even
so
i
find
myself
feeling
as
empty
as
ever
i'm
just
so
damn
lonely
love
please
what
would
we
do
without
black
people
be
able
to
leave
doors
unlocked
without
fear
the
walking
dead
this
week
i
just
i
can't
even
anyone
have
a
shoulder
i
can
cry
on
i
come
to
campus
with
two
different
types
of
standards
regular
standards
and
depauw
standards
why
because
a
majority
of
the
girls
on
this
campus
are
shot
white
black
asian
etc
i
be
praying
for
the
day
i
can
get
back
into
the
city
and
see
some
beautiful
women
but
what
really
grinds
my
gears
is
that
the
girls
here
really
believe
that
they're
more
than
what
they
are
especially
the
white
ones
like
we
know
you
don't
act
like
that
back
home
because
someone
would've
put
you
in
your
place
the
only
reason
half
of
these
guys
give
you
play
is
because
the
only
other
option
is
go
fuck
horses
and
cows
don't
let
that
feed
into
your
head
that
is
all

i
walked
into
bio
lab
section
last
week
and
my
ta
seemed
chill
he
starts
saying
how
he
usually
only
teaches
upper
division
and
how
he
would
treat
us
like
adults
we
could
have
our
phones
out
during
lab
just
don't
text
when
he's
talking
blah
blah
starts
going
over
course
stuff
right
and
then
this
guy
in
the
front
row
starts
texting
out
of
no
where
the
ta
grabs
his
phone
breaks
it
in
half
and
throws
it
in
the
trash
the
student
got
up
wtf
man
and
walked
over
to
the
trash
to
get
it
he
had
some
lg
flip
phone
kinda
deal
with
the
keypad
the
ta
yelled
get
out
of
my
class
and
then
when
the
student
finally
did
he
proceded
on
like
nothing
had
happened
is
it
just
me
or
is
my
ta
fucking
crazy
2nd
is
this
legal
also
random
side
note
confession
these
2
girls
in
my
class

flirting
with
my
ta
like
giggling
and
poking
him
with
their
pencil
shit
is
getting
weird
in
that
class
have
any
ideas
that
you
think
would
make
madison
confessions

better
perhaps
a
chat
room
a
discussion
board
or
something
entirely
unique
we
are
open
and
accepting
of
all
suggestions

free
to

by
someone
yelling
chinese
476
i
tend
to
lie
in
every
interaction
i
have
with
people
usually
starts
with
how
are
you
doing
good
and
while
i
would
never
physically
hurt
myself
when
i'm
upset
or
downed
i
tend
to
try
to
cut
my
ties
with
my
friends
to
no
avail
so
in
a
sense
i
cut
myself
mentally
1734
last
night
i
saw
a
guy
run
across
the
street
on
while
on
his
cell
phone
straight
to
a
girl
on
the
other
side
who
was
hiding
behind
a
tree
on
hers
after
chasing
her
around
he
threw
her
into
the
air
laughing
then
they
kissed
passionately
as
he
twirled
her
around
in
his
arms
3
it
was
the
cutest
thing
ever
and
i
actually
missed
the
light
i
waiting
for
to
turn
green
my
confession

i
was
completely
jeal

that
possible
at
ucsb

so
fucking
annoying

just
pooped
a
balloon

ask
a
girl
on
a
date

i
really
want
to
ask
out
this
girl
i
know
but
i
want
to
make
sure

not
too
late
and
for
the
record
we'll
be
living
relatively
close
to
each
other
during
the
summer

a
girl
this
morning
who
was
wearing
a
baseball
cap
oversized
t
shirt
northface
jacket
nike
shorts
and
leggings

trying
to
hate

think

attractive
when
guys
smell
like
beer
why
can't
i
post
on
this
from
my
phone
opinion
from
exchange
student
i
have
noticed
that
people
here
are
very
conservative
especially
when
it
comes
to
relationship
abortion
and
sex
does
this
conservative
opinon
change
when
you
go
out
to
north
gate
we
don't
get
it
5514
am
i
the
only

1
perez
or
pozzi
thanks
and
gig
em
so
excited
to
start
my
life
as
an
ag
6014
help
i'm
in
love
with
my
ta
any
advice
walked
under
the
friendship
branch
of
century
tree
with
a
guy
i
really
like
last
night
why
did
i
do
that
friend
zoned
for
life
i
saw
this
meme
or
picture
about
how
the
parents
were
taking
their
child
to
a
prince
and
princess
theme
party
and
the
boy
asked
to
be
a
princess
and
they
let
them
the
picture
was
about
how
inspirational
it
was
for
the
parents
to
be
open
about
it
and
at
the
party
other
parents
felt
bad
about
the
boy
who
dressed
up
as
a
princess
that
their
parents
did
that
to
him
but
none
of
the
kids
frowned
upon
it
or
anything
because
the
kids
dont
know
any
better
why
do
you
think
the
gays
were
hated
on
because
we
all
in
the
inside
thinks
that
we
do
not
want
homosexuality
to
be
okay
in
the
society
i
am
sure
its
normal
some
kind
of
instinct
to
not
want
to
see
those
stuff
what
am
i
saying
i
dont
know
but
ew
812
i
hate
it
when
people
complain
about
the
tuition
going
up
what
the
fuck
did
you
expect
did
you
really
think
the
trustees
and
people
in
charge
of
the
school's
finances
would
decide
this
year
especially
that
they
should
cut
down
and
be
one
of
the
only
colleges
in
the
nation
to
do
so
no
it's
not
practical
and
as
much
as
i
hate
working
my
ass
off
in
the
summer
to
barely
scrape
enough
money
together
to
afford
a
freaking
meal
plan
i
understand
that
i
was
the
one
who
chose
this
school
and
now
i
have
to
work
hard
to
put
my
money
to
good
use
so
stop
complaining
about
our
tuition
going
up
you're
the
one
who
chose
lafayette
the
price
was
clearly
presented
to
you
multiple
times
before
you
even
applied
and
if
you
didn't
get
a
scholarship
then
you
should
have
worked
harder
in
high
school
fuck
it
i
didn't
get
a
scholarship
either
but
i
work
hard
every
day
i'm
here
to
make
sure
that
when
i'm
out
of
college
and
looking
at
grad
school
i
get
chosen
over
all
the
people
who
bitched
and
complained
along
the
way
my
confession
is
i
am
an
international
student
and
i
am
super
excited
to
go
home
in
one
month
i
am
also
excited
because
i
have
a
long
layover
and
my
airline
is
most
likely
going
to
give
me
free
accommodation
meals
transport
and
visa
to
that
country
win
win
all
i
do
is
win
win
win
can
december
be
here
already
please
question
to
the
guys
on
this
page
what
are
five
things
you
look
for
most
in
a
girl
what
are
five
things
you
stay
away
from
thanks
to
those
who
say
strait
is
better
than
cash
what
is
your
argument
besides
your
bias
i
must
admit
i
am
somewhat
biased
too
but
you
can
ask
anyone
outside
of
the
country
genre
who
johnny
cash
is
and
you'll
get
a
response
either
good
or
bad
if
you
pose
the
same
question
about
strait
you
might
get
a
who
or
maybe
even
a
i
hate
country
cash
was
his
own
man
and
his
music
reflected
it
he
was
not
only
a
country
singer
but
a
singer
to
the
heart
and
soul
of
people
he
was
a
great
story
teller
with
my
opinion
for
the
most
part
stated
what
is
your
opinion
and
i
would
like
to
understand
your
perspective
thanks
and
gig
em
so
today
i
was
walking
to
class
when
what
do
i
see
a
girl
with
her
ass
cheeks
hanging
out
of
those
short
shorts
really
like
did
you
not
check
to
make
sure
your
shorts
fit
before
you
walk
out
the
door
or
are
you
wanting
to
get
some
after
class
girl
cover
those
cheeks
with
more
denim
please
for
the
love
of
reveille
and
all
things
maroon
i
had
sex
with
my
girlfriend
on
the
seal
by
the
doors
of
peirce
it
was
great
but
i
think
i
might
have
just
failed
my
comps
because
of
it
worth
it
13739
why
does
that
one
guy
who
thinks
society
is
equal
feel
the
need
to
jump
and
comment
on
almost
every
status
what
exactly
do
you
think
you're
achieving
17495
i'm
a
freshman
and
an
international
student
i
was
on
top
of
my
school
but
i
came
here
and
bombed
all
four
of
my
prelims
even
the
one
i
thought
i
was
good
at
i
don't
think
i
fit
into
cornell
either
it's
so
close
to
mingle
with
american
people
should
i
go
back
any
girl
want
a
good
boyfriend
i
want
someone
to
care
about
uw
madison
has
changed
my
life
forever
i
have
met
my
best
friends
here
and
probably
my
wife
some
day
as
i
sit
in
the
library
before
i
rage
tonight
i
realized
how
blessed
we
all
are
to
be
here
it's
just
not
like
any
other
school
i
had
a
decent
high
school
experience
and
still
talk
to
some
friends
but
the
bonds
i
have
formed
with
fellow
badgers
will
surpass
the
friendships
i
had
in
high
school
my
confession
well
it's
what
i've
said
i
consider
uw
madison
to
be
the
greatest
place
in
the
world
and
everyone
that
goes
here
realizes
it
on
wisconsin
it's
my
third
year
of
college
and
i've
never
felt
more
alone
my
grades
are
the
best
they've
ever
been
but
thats
only
because
nobody
ever
asks
me
to
hang
out
i
literally
don't
have
anything
to
do
other
than
study
and
refresh
facebook
over
and
over
i've
gotta
say
if
there's
one
thing
i
miss
about
high
school
it
would
be
feeling
like
everybody
cared
about
me
and
genuinely
enjoyed
and
wanted
to
spend
time
with
me
i
don't
know
why
i
have
such
a
hard
time
making
friends
here
i
feel
like
every
time
i
attempt
to
start
a
conversation
with
someone
it
dies
within
the
first
five
minutes
i'm
a
nice
girl
why
can't
i
just
be
social
please
post
this
does
beutel
do
std
testing
if
so
does
it
cost
anything
would
it
appear
on
any
forms
that
my
parents
would
see
shitty
day
if
this
guy
turns
out
to
be
gay
too
then
i'm
officially
giving
up
how
does
this
keep
happening

am

the
perfect

a

my
boyfriend
and
i
are
in
a
long
distance
relationship
right
now
i've
cheated
on
him
a
few
times
out
of
boredom
and
loneliness
but
i
still
love
him
would
he
still
love
me
if
he
knew
i
got
kicked
out
of
logan's
on
halloween
weekend
for
nearly
getting
into
a
fight
i
guess
it's
not
a
good
idea
to
ask
black
people
george
w
bush
great
president
or
greatest
president
even
though
you're
dressed
as
stephen
colbert
and
are
carrying
around
your
copy
of
i
am
america
and
so
can
you
is
a
clitoris

rare

i've
been
with
my
boyfriend
since
frosh
year
and
we've
been
through
a
lot
and
i
love
him
like
crazy
senior
year
is
approaching
and
i
know
he's
the
guy
for
me
so
how
long
should
we
wait
before
he
pops
the
question
are
there
good
hispanic
clubs
organizations
that
party
a
lot
p
wouldn't
it
be
like
so
totally
awesome
if
texas
was
like
california
sigh
maybe
someday
i
refuse
to
grind
i
think
it's
disgusting
can
we
bring
actual
dancing
back
please
not
just
simulated
butt
sex
dear
all
you
fake
tanners
i
wonder
do
you
know
that
you
are
orange
or
do
you
actually
think
you
look
good
look
maybe
your
friends
are
just
so
sh
ty
that
they
don't
tell
you
look
like
an
oompa
loompa
sincerely
pale
and
proud
hey
cc
females
whats
y'alls
opinion
of
when
guys
dress
nice
preppy
what
would
i
do
without
rice
to
provide
me
with
a
nonstop
source
of
villainous
fairy
tales
to
complain
about
first
the
misinformation
rice
suggests
that
anyone
who
dares
to
proscribe
it
and
its
hangers
on
as
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
the
people
can
expect
to
suffer
hair
loss
and
tooth
decay
as
a
result
where
the
heck
did
it
come
up
with
that
well
i'm
sure
rice
would
rather
keep
essential
documents
hidden
from
the
public
until
they
become
politically
moot
than
answer
that
particular
question
contrary
to
the
rousseauian
ideal
of
the
transparency
of
the
general
will
to
itself
we
need
to
look
beyond
the
most
immediate
and
visible
problems
with
rice
we
need
to
look
at
what
is
behind
these
problems
and
understand
that
rice's
policy
of
ushering
in
the
beginning
of
an
abusive
new
era
of
sexism
must
not
go
unchallenged
to
leave
it
unchallenged
is
to
condone
rice's
grandiose
plans
for
world
hegemony
plans
in
which
no
one
is
free
to
say
that
rice
knows
how
to
lie
it's
too
bad
it
doesn't
yet
understand
the
ramifications
of
lying
call
me
old
fashioned
but
i'm
not
writing
this
letter
for
your
entertainment
i'm
not
even
writing
it
for
your
education
i'm
writing
it
for
our
very
survival
if
rice
continues
to
hammer
a
few
more
nails
into
the
coffin
of
freedom
i
will
be
obliged
to
do
something
about
it
and
you
know
me
i
never
neglect
my
obligations
the
underlying
message
is
that
rice's
vilipensive
modes
of
thought
reduce
principle
to
an
expedient
no
joke
please
don't
ask
me
to
destroy
our
moral
fiber
i
simply
can't
do
that
rice's
list
of
sins
is
long
and
each
one
deserves
more
space
than
i
have
here
therefore
rather
than
describe
each
one
individually
i'll
summarize
by
stating
that
i
have
a
hard
time
reasoning
with
people
who
remain
calm
when
they
see
rice
transmogrifying
society's
petty
gripes
and
irrational
fears
into
issues
to
be
catered
to
even
without
the
dissolute
ideology
of
nihilism
in
the
picture
we
can
still
say
that
many
of
the
things
that
rice's
squadristi
write
make
no
sense
for
example
what
do
they
mean
by
doing
the
fashionable
thing
is
more
important
than
life
or
liberty
maybe
reading
that
sentence
backwards
reveals
a
hidden
message
or
maybe
it's
simply
the
case
that
rice
likes
to
imply
that
the
future
of
the
entire
world
rests
in
its
hands
this
is
what
its
escapades
amount
to
although
of
course
they're
daubed
over
with
the
viscid
slobber
of
pharisaical
drivel
devised
by
its
faithfuls
and
mindlessly
multiplied
by
the
worst
types
of
temerarious
feebleminded
whiners
i've
ever
seen
i
mean
defeatism
is
not
merely
an
attack
on
our
moral
fiber
it
is
also
a
politically
motivated
attack
on
knowledge
whenever
rice
tries
to
fortify
our
feeble
spirits
with
a
few
rehearsed
words
of
bravado
i
can't
help
but
think
that
it
has
conceived
the
project
of
reigning
over
opinions
and
of
conquering
neither
kingdoms
nor
provinces
but
the
human
mind
if
this
project
succeeds
then
pompous
obnoxious
philodoxes
will
be
free
to
renege
on
an
incredibly
large
number
of
promises
even
worse
it
will
be
illegal
for
anyone
to
say
anything
about
how
i
deeply
believe
that
it's
within
our
grasp
to
take
personal
action
and
study
the
impact
on
society
of
rice's
greed
stupidity
hubris
and
outright
corruption
be
grateful
for
this
first
and
last
tidbit
of
comforting
news
the
rest
of
this
letter
will
center
around
the
way
that
it
screams
and
cries
whenever
it's
prevented
from
pandering
to
our
worst
fears
i
contend
that
if
it
stopped
acting
like
such
a
big
baby
maybe
then
it'd
see
that
it
claims
that
society
will
benefit
if
it
goes
ahead
with
its
plan
to
acquire
power
and
use
it
to
indoctrinate
unregenerate
subversive
types
that's
like
pulling
up
a
plant
to
see
how
the
roots
are
doing
it
also
proves
that
rice
is
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
its
catch
phrases
are
based
on
two
fundamental
errors
they
assume
that
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
is
the
care
to
know
how
many
fucks
i'm
currently
giving
too
many
that's
how
many
251
why
do
people
ignore
asians
here
don't
think
that
we
are
quite
little
girls
without
opinions
we
can
whip
your
ass
gangnam
style
don't
mess
so
i've
been
wondering
for
the
longest
time
admins
do
you
even
lift
7280
people
need
to
learn
what
the
hell
it
is
to
wait
in
a
line
for
a
bus
think
teachers
made
you
line
up
in
kindergarten
for
no
reason
damn
so
what
if
i
want
to
wear
an
oversized
shirt
everyday
how
about
you
try
looking
at
it
from
someone
else's
perspective
before
you
start
bashing
it
1
it
comfortable
2
in
the
summer
it's
breezier
than
wearing
a
tight
fitting
shirt
also
it
doesn't
show
sweat
as
much
as
a
tight
shirt
would
3
in
the
winter
i
usually
wear
leggings
because
once
again
my
main
concern
is
comfort
and
a
big
shirt
is
able
cover
up
my
butt
and
crotch
more
girls
need
to
consider
wearing
bigger
shirts
in
the
winter
because
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
being
able
to
see
their
bare
butt
through
their
leggings

newsflash
fellas
i
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
wake
up

i
can
wear
to
get
the
attention
of
a
bunch
of

main
concern

school
shocker
and
if
you
don't
like
that
i
don't
really
care
okay

the
end
of
my
rant

am
so
afraid
of
writing
a
bad
essay

i
can
barely
even
start
what
is
this
11387
what
have
i
done
i
am
so
so
sorry
something
that
neither
of
us
remembers
that
well
ruined
everything
in
a
matter
of
minutes
and
now
i'm
scared
of
and
disgusted
at
myself
there
hasn't
been
a
day
since
that
i
haven't
been
miserable
please
forgive
me
i'm
sorry
i
betrayed
everyone
some
guys
want
a
girl
that
have
no
will
of
her
own
some
guys
want
a
girl
who
will
make
him
feel
important
some
want
a
girl
who
won't
hold
him
down
me
i'm
a
simple
guy
with
simple
tastes

want
a
girl
who

i
am
a
gay
freshman
and
i
want
to
hook
up
with
some
of
the
guys
in
my
dorm
i
would
love
to
hook
up
with
two
guys
at
the
same
time
is
that
wrong
i
am
thinking
about
just
being
open
and
going
for
it
and
asking
these
two
other
gentlemen
in
my
dorm
i
won't
give
them
away
but
they
are
a
husky
ish
white
kid
and
his
indian
looking
roommate
i
just
have
a
feeling
that
they
would
be
down
i'm
in
a
relationship
with
this
girl
and
she
just
got
out
of
a
relationship
before
the
summer
started
and
i'm
starting
to
wonder
if
i'm
just
a
rebound
or
if
she
actually
likes
me
i
also
can't
figure
out
if
she
just
wants
to
have
fun
or
if
she
wants
something
serious
we
haven't
been
going
at
it
that
long
but
if
it's
just
for
fun
i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
do
this
same
case
if
i'm
just
a
rebound
i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
ask
her
wothout
sounding
like
i'm
trying
to
move
too
fast
i'm
very
happy
with
taking
it
slow
as
long
as
it's
leading
somewhere
any
words
5170
i
feel
like
i
need
to
make
a
giant
apology
to
the
entire
nyu
community
because
my
parents
were
financially
responsible
and
saved
enough
money
during
their
lives
to
give
me
a
good
life
but
because
i
don't
have
at
least
two
part
time
jobs
that
makes
me
a
shitty
person
right
fuck
i
feel
bad
for
your
children
if
that's
your
perception
of
the
world
if
i
can't
support
my
kids
through
college
i'll
feel
like
i've
failed
as
a
parent
why
is
flirting
so
confusing
how
am
i
supposed
to
know
when
a
guy
is
looking
for
a
relationship
or
a
fuck
buddy
i
don't
wear
underwear
when
i
wear
yoga
pants
is
that
okay
i
feel
like
people
who
are
uglier
than
i
at
this
school
do
much
better
socially
what
the
eff
am
i
doing
wrong
17931
my
life
is
in
a
complete
rut
and
i
am
on
the
brink
of
a
kind
of
mental
breakdown
i've
never
had
before
i
have
no
confidence
i
have
no
real
friends
i've
never
had
a
girlfriend
my
life
is
completely
pathetic
i
am
successful
academically
and
professionally
thank
you
cornell
but
people
are
like
a
foreign
species
to
me
unfortunately
i
am
one
of
them
and
i
need
to
interact
with
them
to
stay
sane
and
i
need
to
stop
screwing
up
with
girls
and
going
on
crazy
emotional
rollercoasters
every
time
i
have
a
crush
so
what
am
i
going
to
do
i'm
going
to
stop
masturbating
it
will
be
a
big
challenge
and
it
will
change
my
brain
function
substantially
i
don't
know
for
better
or
for
worse
but
it
will
have
a
major
impact
on
my
life
and
that's
what
i
need
it
is
the
only
thing
that
i
solely
control
and
can
do
to
change
my
life
short
of
killing
myself
i
used
to
see
testosterone
as
the
enemy
as
it
made
me
desire
girls
that
i
knew
i
could
not
get
which
led
to
depression
now
i'm
going
to
look
at
it
as
a
friend
let
it
build
up
quite
literally
and
see
what
that
does
to
my
confidence
my
interaction
with
people
and
my
outlook
on
life
is
this
going
to
be
insanely
difficult
yes
am
i
going
to
do
it
yes
i've
accomplished
a
lot
in
my
life
i
can
refrain
from
doing
a
silly
thing
after
the
first
week
your
testosterone
shoots
up
to
200
brah
you
got
dis
if
a
straight
girl
wants
to
mess
around
with
another
girl
nobody
will
bat
an
eye
or
think
twice
she
is
just
experimenting
right
but
if
i
a
straight
man
even
think
about
messing
around
with
another
guy
then
a
whole
shit
storm
comes
crashing
down
what
the
fuck
is
up
with
this
double
standard
i
want
to
comment
like
on
some
of
these
so
bad
but
do
not
want
anyone
to
know
who
i
am
haha
why
can't
there
be
an
anonymous
commenting
option

nothing
is
stopping
gravity

today
i
smiled
at
someone
going
the
opposite
way
on
the
bike
path
they
actually
did
a
double
take
what
surprised
someone
is
trying
to
make
your
day
better
i've
been
trying
to
smile
at
strangers
to
break
my
own
shell
and
because
maybe
somewhere
one
of
those
people
needed
that
smile
and
feel
a
little
better
because
of
it
smile
on
ucsb
if
i
decide
that
i
want
to
be
a
teacher
after
i
graduate
can
i
just
take
a
test
to
be
certified
or
do
i
have
to
do
another
program
is
bemis
a
good
place
to
live
11343
i'm
jealous
of
people
who
know
how
to
take
good
pictures
and
then
good
at
using
adobe
photoshop
to
edit
it
and
make
it
look
better
teach
me
someone
9721
i
am
so
sick
of
guys
seeing
me
as
someone
to
sleep
with
it
wont
happen
is
there
anybody
at
cornell
that
doesnt
want
a
one
night
stand
13446
i
entered
cornell
last
year
as
a
freshman
with
no
cavities
or
teeth
decay
today
i
went
to
the
dentist
only
to
find
out
that
i
now
have
nine
cavities
what
the
hell
beware
of
dining
hall
treats
and
excessive
use
of
brbs
incoming
freshmen
the
c
in
cornell
stands
for
cavities
i'm
muslim
and
so
are
my
parents
some
of
my
family
are
christians
some
are
jewish
and
one
of
my
aunts
is
even
buddhist
my
entire
family
no
matter
how
religiously
diverse
we
are
are
very
religious
and
true
to
it
i've
always
had
a
passion
for
science
and
i
never
understood
why
people
believed
in
it
over
the
idea
of
god
or
multiple
gods
i'm
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
my
science
major
and
how
it
works
and
i'm
so
ashamed
to
say
that
i
just
can't
find
myself
believing
in
a
god
anymore
my
entire
family
would
disown
me
and
lately
i
can't
even
find
it
in
me
to
pray
anymore
and
it
kills
me
inside
because
what
if
there
just
might
be
a
god
and
i
chose
to
believe
science
over
my
religion
and
god
my
mind
is
a
constant
debate
over
science
evolution
energy
religion
god
hell
heaven
i
feel
so
restless
17709
i
am
a
girl
and
right
now
all
i
want
to
do
is
cuddle
with
another
girl
is
that
too
much
to
ask
for
to
other
girls
would
you
be
weirded
out
if
you
found
out
that
a
friend
of
yours
wanted
to
cuddle
with
you
3970
can
someone
tell
me
who
the
lau
hobo
is
5456
are
any
of
the
ns3
boys
actually
interested
in
having
a
relationship
instead
of
random
hook
ups
because
from
what
i
see
i'm
starting
to
lose
hope
17517
i
do
not
care
if
you're
male
female
gay
straight
somewhere
in
between
rich
poor
black
white
asian
hispanic
native
american
purple
muslim
christian
jewish
atheist
pastafarian
republican
democrat
independent
or
anything
else
that
people
like
to
discriminate
by
you
know
what
i
don't
like
people
setting
the
toaster
on
fire
in
the
dining
hall
1848
i
like
being
alone
just
sitting
in
my
room
and
listening
to
music
and
doing
homework
or
whatever
sounds
just
fantastic
to
me
i
do
like
people
a
lot
they're
super
cool
most
of
the
time
and
i
wish
i
was
better
at
talking
to
them
but
you
know
i'm
also
totally
okay
with
just
being
alone
very
okay
with
it
in
fact
is
that
bad
it
feels
like
i
should
feel
bad
about
it
5894
i
wish
i
went
up
to
you
at
that
party
last
night
i
just
couldn't
muster
the
courage
before
you
ended
up
leaving
so
early
you're
just
so
goddamn
adorable
next
time
though
now
that
i
know
you're
into
guys
my
classroom
crush
from
two
years
ago
could
actually
be
something
for
once
but
i
guess
nothing
is
ever
going
to
happen
if
i
don't
at
least
say
hi
1838
i
found
a
bag
of
pills
today
at
the
bus
stop
on
el
colegio
and
just
googled
them
online
turns
out
it's
addy

there's
like
60
of
them
i
have
no
idea
what
wtf
to
do
take
them
turn
them
in
sell
them
the
angel
on
my
right
shoulder
is
taking
a
beating
from
the
devil
on
my
left
why
does
shit
like
this
happen
when
i'm
trying
to
be
a
good
guy
and
clean
up
my

i
tend
to
panic
when
i
see
a
bunch
of
football
players
looking
at
me
do
they
approve
of
what
they
see
or
not
i
have
the
biggest
crush
on
the
admins
like
imugur
am
i
doing
it
right
i
find
female
mma
fighters
and
fitness
models
very
attractive
but
when
i
voice
those
opinions
i
am
met
with
objections
almost

that
there
is

some
girls
boys
feel
like
they
need
to
put
a
label
on
a
relationship
but
what
is
a
label
really
it
is
so
easy
for
someone
to
say
okay
i'll
be
your
girlfriend
boyfriend
sure
the
label
is
great
and
it
will
come
in
time
but
that
is
not
what
is
important
feelings
are
important
how
two
individuals
feel
about
each
other
and
treat
each
other
i
personally
would
rather
be
in
a
relationship
that
has
no
title
than
a
crappy
relationship
that
has
the
titles
of
boyfriend
and
girlfriend
this
school
is
pretty
small
why
is
it
that
the
only
person
you're
dying
to
run
into
is
the
one
you
never
do

hey
you

my

i
were
looking

to
seeing

i
hate
how
it's

sexist
when

only
racist
when
white

do

do

are
you
perchance
a

where

i
think
a
m
doesn't
take
the
drinking
culture
at
school
seriously
enough
its
all
a
laugh
to
them
who
else
is
going
to
graduate
an
alcoholic
the
school
should
have
better
support
and
help
advertised
and
not
just
write
off
the
problem
as
something
people
at
this
age
do
ie:drinking
every
weekend
would
you
lick
a
zombies
ball
sack
for
"500,000"
m
when
a
corps
guy
or
i
guess
anyone
for
that
matter
tells
you
to
pm
him
what
the
f
does
that
mean
so
something
has
been
bugging
me
lately
my
ex
and
i
have
been
broken
up
for
4
years
he
has
messaged
me
on
facebook
or
texted
me
once
every
year
the
day
before
my
birthday
trying
to
check
in
and
see
how
things
are
but
it
ends
up
as
him
trying
to
pick
a
fight
and
getting
butthurt
i
have
never
tried
contacting
him
after
we
broke
up
these
annual
check
ins
are
literally
all
we
have
talked
about
since
the
break
up
at
first
his
annual
messages
irritated
me
but
then
i
realized
that
he
either
a
misses
me
and
realizes
he
fucked
up
or
b
hates
me
so
much
that
he
tries
to
start
a
fight
with
me
t
note
he
was
the
one
that
messed
up
the
relationship
and
ended
it
why
would
a
guy
do
this
24
hours
in
a
day
24
beers
in
a
case
coincidence
10466
i
have
literally
no
idea
what
the
talking
traffic
lights
are
saying
how
am
i
supposed
to
cross
the
street
safely
12285
where
are
all
the
nice
lesbians
who
want
a
relationship
welpimsingle
i
wanna
meet
some
nice
jewish
boys
are
there
any
jewish
groups
on
campus
i
have
never
kissed
some
of
my
friends
give
me
weird
looks
when
i
tell
them
that
am
i
weird
726
is
hoyas
hookups
even
a
real
thing
i
feel
like
this
is
probably
going
to
be
20
odd
desperate
guys
waiting
for
a
message
back
that
never
comes

what
the
fuck
is
a
barbour
jacket
4003
does
anyone
know
if
the
amazingly
beautiful
girl
with
the
blue
eyes
shes
tan
average
height
working
at
ctb
goes
here
i
wanna
talk
to
her
but
itd
be
weird
as
hell
if
she
was
just
a
local
senior
in
high
school
or
something
haha
16196
dear
asian
girls
why
are
so
many
of
you
so
attractive
9983
there's
a
guy
with
whom
i
hooked
up
last
semester
and
i'd
love
to
do
it
again
on
a
regular
basis
he's
very
anti
relationship
and
i
don't
want
a
relationship
with
him
at
all
not
beyond
the
physical
but
i'm
afraid
he'll
think
i
do
i'm
just
a
girl
that
loves
hooking
up
but
would
like
someone
steady
and
reliable
to
hook
up
with
how
do
i
ask
him
if
he'd
basically
like
to
be
friends
with
benefits
without
scaring
him
4644
why
is
it
so
hard
to
find
a
girl
who
is
looking
for
a
relationship
do
you
ever
love
someone
so
much
but
you
know
they
don't
have
feelings
for
you
and
you
love
them
and
hate
them
all
at
once
if
you
have
i
feel
you
if
you
haven't
i
wouldn't
recommend
it
anyone
ever
wonder
why
teachers
buy
and
tell
us
the
buy
the
200
dollar
us
version
of
all
our
textbooks
while
there
are
almost
always
international
edition
ones
floating
around
for
literally
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
cost
of
the
us
one
its
nonsensical
for
the
teachers
to
even
begin
using
one
in
the
first
place
when
the
information
in
each
is
virtually
the
same
between
us
and
international
edition
straight
robbery
going
down
on
campuses
across
the
nation
while
the
man
is
pulling
the
wool
over
all
our
eyes
don't
be
a
ridiculously
priced
textbook
buying
sheep
feeding
the
wolf
that
is
the
textbook
corporations

all
i
want
for
christmas
is
my
boyfriends
v
card
do
robots
use
aluminum
foil
as
condoms
or
some
other
way
to
prevent
the
spread
of
computer
viruses
i
feel
like
i
botched
things
up
between
us
because
now
we
are
barely
even
friends
i've
seen
you
twice
this
semester
can
you
please
come
out
of
hiding
and
i'll
try
to
do
the
same
since
we're
graduating
i
know
i'll
probably
never
talk
to
you
again
and
i
miss
laughing
with
you
and
i'm
not
the
only
one
who
misses
you
who
are
the
least
caring
people
in
the
world
virgins
they
don't
give
a
fuck
2589
in
response
to
2588
the
tisch
student
ranting
about
cas
stern
students
first
of
all
we
do
have
more
work
than
you
aside
from
homework
classes
and
studying
some
of
us
have
internships
start
ups
writing
jobs
and
smart
things
to
do
in
our
time
i'm
pretty
sure
that
making
a
film
is
much
easier
than
say
solving
economic
problems
or
running
a
business
don't
you
dare
complain
about
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
a
freaking
film
second
some
of
us
intellectuals
did
follow
our
dreams
by
going
into
stern
or
cas
developing
our
minds
is
what
makes
us
happy
lastly
do
you
think
you'll
be
proud
of
yourself
after
you
don't
find
a
job
with
your
film
degree
how
many
arts
students
actually
become
famous
or
successful
one
day
very
very
little
please
think
about
your
words
before
you
rant
anonymously
on
a
secrets
page
i
am
honestly
sick
of
tisch
kids
pretending
like
they're
better
than
the
rest
of
the
school
because
you
have
famous
alumni
and
you
guys
are
artistic
and
followed
your
dreams
8161
i
will
often
look
at
someone
and
think
how
did
ever
make
it
to
cornell
usually
this
occurs
when
i'm
looking
in
the
mirror
who
is
that
guy
in
the
wheelchair
i
seriously
think
he
is
in
every
organization
on
campus
everywhere
i
go
he
is
always
there
doing
something
6739
is
it
normal
to
be
jealous
of
a
friend's
other
friends
i
met
one
of
my
good
friends
here
in
a
really
weird
way
so
our
friend
groups
don't
overlap
at
all
i
like
that
she's
separate
from
my
main
group
of
friends
but
i
wish
we
were
closer
so
i
get
jealous
when
i
see
her
hanging
out
with
her
main
group
of
friends
i'm
especially
jealous
of
her
relationship
with
her
sorority
lineage
i
don't
understand
why
i'm
so
jealous
and
i
feel
really
guilty
about
all
of
it
in
response
to
the
senior
plus
who
wants
to
get
down
in
kingsbury
we
got
two
ladies
in
waiting
who
have
put
up
4.5
years
of
work
and
got
none
in
kings
let's
change
that
if
i
see
one
more
outraged
facebook
post
about
some
instance
of
cultural
appropriation
i
will
lose
it
do
you
white
girls
do
anything
besides
express
outrage
on
the
internet
do
you
volunteer
your
time
for
real
causes
do
you
go
to
the
inner
city
and
work
to
change
a
child's
life
so
it
doesn't
have
to
become
the
stereotype
you're
trying
to
dispel
of
course
you
don't
and
you
don't
because
you've
been
allowed
to
believe
that
there
is
no
hierarchy
of
societal
problems
and
therefore
expressing
your
outrage
over
cultural
appropriation
is
analogous
to
helping
real
race
issues
if
you
ever
decide
to
get
offended
by
war
and
poverty
let
me
know
though
i'm
sure
the
increase
in
facebook
posts
would
alert
me
first
go
do
something
real
who
is
the
super
cute
petite
brunette
girl
who
was
at
the
rec
around
830
to
9
in
a
blue
tank
top
and
yoga
pants
you
had
a
notebook
with
you
and
you
were
doing
reverse
pushups
with
plates
on
your
legs
you
are
absolutely
beautiful
i
love
my
roommate
she
is
a
very
sweet
girl
however
she
is
always
saying
how
difficult
her
classes
are
how
much
she
works
that
she
has
no
time
etc
she
is
only
taking
12
hours
and
only
works
7
hours
a
week
she
acts
as
if
i
am
not
in
school
and
busy
all
the
time
or
that
i
don't
understand
her
pain
it
makes
me
really
upset
because
the
way
she
says
it
makes
it
seem
like
she
undervalues
my
time
or
thinks
i
just
sit
around
all
day
what
should
i
do
i
have
already
tried
to
express
my
concern
to
her
but
she
still
does
it
15167
to
the
people
with
anime
characters
as
their
profile
picture
why
the
f
ck
is
that
your
picture
how
is
it
helping
you
in
any
department
of
your
life
you
look
crazy
and
odd
and
need
to
fix
that
crap
asap
it
isn't
cute
at
all
and
i
can't
judge
you
on
your
appearance
i
slept
with
a
guy
in
the
corps
out
of
peer
pressure
one
night
while
my
boyfriend
is
stationed
in
korea
i
feel
horrible
about
it
and
i
don't
know
if
i
should
tell
him
i
got
tested
and
i'm
clean
however
i
don't
want
to
lose
him
he's
such
a
great
guy
and
he's
more
of
a
man
than
anyone
i
just
had
a
moment
of
weakness
i
don't
want
to
lose
him
should
i
tell
him
11799
i've
started
to
get
emotional
lately
i
know
it's
to
be
expected
but
i
don't
like
it
cornell
was
the
right
place
for
me
the
true
as
f
ck
friends
i've
made
and
my
personal
growth
are
proof
enough
i
even
learned
to
let
things
go
and
found
some
sort
of
inner
peace
or
at
least
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
i
finally
managed
to
chill
and
just
be
i've
been
cherishing
my
friends
and
trying
to
be
a
yes
man
yet
no
matter
how
much
love
i
surround
myself
with
during
the
day
when
it's
just
me
at
night
i
get
the
blues
separation
anxiety
with
a
bit
of
loneliness
i
know
it'll
pass
and
that
i'm
a
lucky
bastard
for
all
that
life
has
given
me
thus
far
but
it
still
disorients
me
what
more
do
i
want
to
do
in
the
few
weeks
i
have
left
one
last
sexual
rampage
some
ill
timed
romance
i
don't
know
if
i
want
to
just
lie
on
the
grass
and
read
or
fill
every
second
with
activities
given
the
nature
of
humans
i
probably
want
it
all
deep
breath
deep
breath
one
at
a
time
i'll
miss
you
cornell
you
bitch
i
don't
really
enjoy
partying
or
find
it
particularly
useful
so
i
rarely
do
it
i've
been
told
i'm
not
the
only
one
and
that
this
is
actually
quite
common
on
campus
but
i
haven't
had
that
experience
i'm
surrounded
by
people
who
go
out
every
night
and
plenty
who
only
go
out
a
few
nights
a
week
but
i've
met
a
nanoscale
amount
of
people
who
prefer
not
to
it's
actually
rather
unfortunate
won't
somebody
go
to
a
late
night
open
mic
in
town
or
demolish
a
twenty
scoop
sundae
with
me
10081
i
honestly
don't
know
why
guys
don't
ask
me
out
everyone
tells
me
i'm
nice
funny
outgoing
and
a
good
looking
guy
i
don't
know
if
everyone
i
know
is
lying
to
me
or
is
it
just
that
i
intimidate
people
i
wish
guys
at
cornell
weren't
so
shy
and
made
moves
on
people
they
found
attractive
i've
done
that
before
but
somehow
i
manage
to
only
like
guys
who
don't
like
me
i
don't
mind
looking
like
an
idiot
sometimes
in
the
name
of
love
but
i
can
only
take
it
for
so
long
i
want
to
be
asked
out
for
a
change
i
want
someone
to
make
me
feel
with
a
kiss
what
i
make
my
friends
feel
with
a
hug
that
love
and
security
that
reassures
them
that
i
will
always
be
there
for
them
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
a
hopeless
romantic
and
that
helps
me
get
through
every
day
with
the
hope
that
a
good
guy
will
ask
me
out
for
coffee
14730
i
wish
there
was
a
way
i
could
learn
to
just
live
in
the
moment
and
be
happy
with
what
i
have
right
now
i
am
too
much
of
a
worrier
always
concerned
about
the
future
and
thinking
about
potentials
and
possibilities
and
disappointments
to
come
it's
good
to
an
extent
as
it
allows
me
to
be
practical
but
i
wish
i
were
less
like
this
in
situations
where
i
don't
need
to
be
i
feel
like
i
would
be
so
much
happier
how
do
i
change
this

i'm
black
and
i
am
addicted
to
white
girls
i
love
them
but
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
them
stay
within
their
social
ethnic
group
that
they
are
afraid
to
give
a
black
man
a
try
i
mean
sometimes
black
mean
don't
have
the
biggest
reputation
but
some
doesn't

and
i
am
about

with
other
bills
i
don't
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
does

gays
here
looking
to
get
with
a
straight
curious
guy
i
just
wanna
try
what
it's
like
to
be
with
a
guy
without
any
strings
attached
or
anyone
finding
out
just
to
see
what
it's
like
and
explore
my
sexuality
so
my
gf
is
hairy
down
on
her
vagina
what's
the
best
way
to
ask
her
to
shave
without
being
rude
are
sherman
and
korena
together
does
it
bother
anyone
else
that
our
mantra
aggies
do
not
lie
cheat
or
steal
or
tolerate
those
who
do
is
grammatically
incorrect
could
yall
only
post
confessions
and
not
opinions
and
questions
it
is
a
m
confessions
right
not
i
want
to
anonymously
state
my
viewpoints
and
get
trolled
i
expect
this
to
make
it
onto
the
page
is
it
a
turn
off
to
guys
if
a
girl
makes
him
wait
a
really
long
time
before
having
sex
i
really
like
this
guy
and
normally
i
love
getting
intimate
right
away
when
i
like
someone
but
i
have
messed
up
by
going
too
fast
in
the
past
this
guy
has
tried
a
couple
times
to
do
more
than
make
out
but
he's
stopped
trying
because
i've
stopped
him
each
time
i'm
worried
that
he
may
be
losing
interest
now
because
he
doesn't
try
to
do
anything
not
even
kiss
unless
i
initiate
it
is
is
bad
if
i
think
about
my
ex
to
get
it
up
when
i'm
with
someone
else
3374
is
anyone
else
terrified
of
graduating
2516
am
i
the
only
one
who
went
home
for
break
and
realized
i
actually
hate
everyone
i
went
to
high
school
with

i
secretly
want
to
ask
the
chess
players
how
to
play
chess
in
washington
square
park
but
people
make
fun
of
me
for
not
knowing
how
to
play
is
it
bad
that
i'm
19
and
don't
know

i
am
madly
in
love
with
the
blonde
hair
guy
who
used
to
work
at
wvbr
can
we
please
just
have
sex
and
get
it
over
with
is
there
a
masonic
presence
on
campus
i'm
just
curious
about
freemasonry
on
or
around
campus
18442
i
want
to
meet
more
chill
people
they're
unfortunately
hard
to
find
here
everyone
seems
so
stressed
and
incapable
of
relaxing
even
once
in
a
while
i
realize
we're
on
a
college
campus
but
everyone
please
take
the
time
to
do
nothing
once
in
a
while
30
minutes
a
day
should
do
just
go
outside
and
stand
there
and
do
nothing
even
if
there's
a
blizzard
and
it's
cold
as
balls
out
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
can
feel
the
cold
and
the
wind
and
the
snow
on
your
face
isn't
that
amazing
life
got
so
much
happier
for
me
once
i
started
appreciating
everything
that
is
take
the
time
off
to
just
be
1086
i
know
that
i'm
smart
and
i
know
that
i
am
beautiful
but
for
some
reason
i
have
the
hardest
time
talking
to
guys
i
start
to
get
squeamish
and
my
russian
accent
which
i
don't
usually
have
spurts
out
of
me
worse
than
diarrhea
after
taco
bell
why
is
it
so
hard
for
me
to
talk
to
the
opposite
sex
i
bet
half
the
time
i
meet
gorgeous
men
they
probably
think
i'm
just
a
stupid
girl
with
a
speech
impediment
and
a
nervous
twitch
guys
give
that
girl
who
you
may
think
is
a
little
special
in
the
head
at
least
one
second
chance
she
might
surprise
you
in
the
end

hi
guys
i
need
some
help
here
i'm
debating
about
whether
to
become
a
christian
or
a
muslim
which
religion
is
more
lenient
in
terms
of
allowing
passage
into
heaven
paradise
allowing
forgiving
having
numerous
sexual
partners
before
marriage
is
a
key
point
for
me
also
can
anyone
comment
on
the
key
differences
between
heaven
and
paradise
which
one
would
a
guy
enjoy
more
thanks
for
your
help
i'll
make
a
decision

a

told
me
at

of
march
that
quote
and
that's
why
i
don't
love
these
hoes
three
weeks
later
he
cried
over
one
of
these
hoes
but
you
don't
love
these
hoes
though
so
why
cry
interesting
paradox
point
being
we
may
act
like
we
don't
buuuut

loves

i
refuse
to

that
i'm
going
to
be
the
only
one
on

at

really
y'all
14279
you
can't
force
people
to
like
you
you
can't
force
people
to
love
themselves
like
you
do
you
can't
force
people
to
change
their
way
of
thinking
you
can't
force
people
to
be
someone
you
feel
they
should
be
and
you
sure
is
as
hell
can't
help
those
who
don't
want
to
help
themselves
i
feel
like
this
is
a
bit
nagging
but
i
really
can't
stand
when
people
post
self
righteous
statuses
about
the
lives
of
others
it
annoys
me
to
no
end
instead
of
taking
a
moment
and
being
empathetic
towards
those
who
are
not
at
the
same
point
in
their
lives
as
you
or
have
a
similar
mindset
it
is
much
easier
to
remind
them
of
their
flawed
being
especially
when
the
common
trend
behind
statuses
such
as
these
come
from
over
privileged
youth
who
think
their
20
some
odd
years
of
existence
gives
them
authority
on
the
experiences
and
existence
of
others
judging
them
by
essentially
saying
why
can't
you
just
be
more
like
me
can
you
for
a
moment
empathize
with
the
reason
behind
a
persons
negative
self
image
or
standstill
in
their
lives
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
person
who
has
never
had
issues
with
their
weight
telling
an
obese
person
why
can't
you
just
lose
weight
it
oversimplifies
their
problems
while
the
likes
on
such
statuses
inflates
the
poster's
ego
also
it
is
not
to
say
hardship
makes
one
an
authority
on
the
lives
of
others
but
it
does
make
a
person
a
little
more
understanding
yes
you
can't
force
a
person
to
love
themselves
but
sit
next
to
them
and
be
a
supportive
hand
until
they
are
ready
to
overcome
whatever
obstacle
that
prevents
them
from
loving
themselves
i
think
am
in
love
with
my
ex
and
he
still
loves
me
the
entire
time
we
broke
up
we
still
kept
in
contact
and
hung
out
with
each
other
constantly
he
is
my
best
friend
but
i
won't
have
time
for
him
when
school
starts
because
i
want
to
focus
on
getting
my
grades
up
should
we
just
stay
friends
for
now
99
i
wish
the
main
campus
kids
can
stop
hating
on
poly
people
already
the
schools
are
merging
and
the
systems
are
starting
to
integrate
poly
acceptance
and
tuition
is
probably
close
to
nyu
standards
now
i
don't
really
see
a
huge
difference
for
you
all
to
complain
about
anymore
if
anything
we
don't
even
get
the
luxurious
campus
and
environment
that
nyu
has
we're
really
just
a
bunch
of
poor
kids
trying
to
get
along
can't
we
all
just
be
friends
and
help
one
another
out
student
life
is
depressing
here
1664
man
white
girls
can
get
trains
ran
on
them
eiffel
towered
poker
faced
and
all
that
freaky
deak
shit
plus
they
can
be
open
as
hell
about
it
but
let
a
black
chick
or
a
latina
chick
try
that
shit
with
a
dude
on
campus
and
its
a
wrap.com
reputation
is
done
everyone
will
always
give
you
that
look
you
know
that
look
where
the
girls
look
like
they
wanna
say
yea
bitch
we
know
what
yo
stank
ass
did
freaky
bitch
and
the
dudes
lmao
look
like
they
wanna
burst
out
laughing
but
deep
down
they
know
they
want
next
why
does
it
have
to
be
that
way
can
we
talk
about
alayna
altman
tho
like
she
is
so
fly
there
must
be
a
line
of
boys
to
get
at
her
ammiright
fellas
i
just
want
someone
to
tell
me
they
love
me
is
that
too
much
to
ask
for
know
what
really
grinds
my
gears
when
people
ignore
you
and
say
it's
awkward
because
you
hooked
up
at
some
point
in
the
past
why
is
that
awkward
why
does
it
warrant
ignoring
someone's
attempts
to
be
friendly
let's
try
and
rethink
post
hookup
etiquette
everyone
it
would
make
things
much
easier
the
dow
just
hit
record
highs
and
corporate
profits
are
at
record
highs
anyone
wanna
tell
me
when
this
all
starts
trickling
down
because
all
i'm
seeing
trickle
down
is
some
piss
sad
christian
boy
here
why
are
so
many
of
the
good
outspoken
christian
girls
ugly
or
fat
or
both
and
dont
go
calling
me
shallow
gotta
find
your
partner
attractive
to
make
it
work
i
want
to
find
a
outspoken
christian
girl
that
way
i
know
they
are
a
true
christian
and
not
one
of
the
ones
who
claim
to
be
a
child
of
christ
but
still
support
gays
who
live
in
sin
condoms
and
other
sinful
things
and
twist
the
words
of
jesus
around
to
support
their
liberal
agendas
like
that
jesus
would
want
people
on
food
stamps
and
bull
hockey
like
that
the
only
way
to
spot
a
true
christian
is
to
find
the
outspoken
ones
who
are
not
scared
to
preach
the
words
of
the
lord
i
just
want
to
find
a
good
christian
country
girl
who
is
outspoken
and
pretty
and
not
already
taken
it
that
so
hard
the
complex
manager
at
the
woodlands
has
had
at
least
six
people
in
her
immediate
family
die
in
the
last
eight
months
and
missed
a
full
week
or
more
of
work
every
time
where
the
heck
do
i
find
a
job
where
i
can
take
off
six
weeks
a
year
without
prior
notice
and
still
be
employed
admin
edit
if
you're
being
snide
and
suggesting
that
her
requests
have
been
fraudulent
then
so
be
it
and
what
not
but
if
you're
saying
this
and
you
know
her
requests
have
been
valid
then
you're
just
being
an
ass
commenting
on
how
much
time
can
be
taken
vs
employment
but
if
you're
serious
read
up.it's
called
bereavement
leave
and
trust
me
you
don't
want
to
have
to
take
it
it
varies
between
company
employer
and
individual
boss
on
how
this
gets
approved
i've
known
an
engineer
who
had
to
miss
work
for
an
entire
year
had
to
go
overseas
after
the
loss
get
things
sorted
out
and
squared
away
in
europe
and
came
back
to
continue
his
duties
here
pay
stops
after
the
end
of
the
formal
bereavement
leave
allotment
but
then
it
can
be
taken
as
unpaid
leave
i
had
a
company
offer
me
3
months
bereavement
and
unpaid
leave
for
a
single
incident
it
all
depends
on
how
much
you're
worth
to
them
your
position
and
length
of
service
and
nature
of
the
situation
is
it
bad
that
i
wipe
my
jizz
on
the
seat
cushions
in
the
library
something
about
a
girl
in
short
shorts
sitting
on
my
crusty's
really
turns
me
on
okay
so
i
want
an
honest
opinion
on
what
people
think
of
corps
guys
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
928
playing
dumb
doesn't
get
you
the
guy
did
i
learn
nothing
from
mean
girls
is
fish
camp
that
impactful
like
do
we
really
meet
our
bffs
here
how
much
would
it
hurt
if
i
miss
it
6385
i'm
actually
planning
to
drop
a
course
right
now
but
i
might
end
up
getting
a
w
should
i
go
for
it
are
y'all
gonna
throw
a
"10,000"
party
confessions
party
i
think
yes
what
are
the
easiest
international
electives
for
business
majors
to
take
at
a
m
and
or
blinn
and
with
which
professors
i
really
just
want
to
use
these
classes
to
raise
my
gpa
once
upon
a
time
i
was
cruising
down
from
the
top
of
main
street
above
the
whitt
intersection
like
i
normally
do
with
a
green
light
ahead
and
i
thought
i'd
pump
thru
it
alongside
the
cars
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
light
turned
red
and
i
quickly
found
myself
going
too
fast
to
pull
a
foot
stop
the
first
car
that
was
slowly
pulling
left
and
out
into
the
intersection
saw
me
and
peeled
out
so
i
could
make
it
through
before
more
traffic
clogged
it
up
right
behind
it
was
a
gables
bus
that
decided
to
slow
to
a
crawl
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
and
watch
me
try
to
unsuccessful
bang
a
hard
emergency
right
hander
onto
college
rd
there
wasn't
enough
room
and
i
ended
up
connecting
full
on
with
the
nose
while
the
driver
and
bus
completely
full
with
passengers
looked
on
my
board
shot
under
the
bus
and
over
onto
the
lawn
in
front
of
morrill
and
i
became
a
human
luge
for
a
split
second
i
had
to
push
myself
away
from
the
front
left
wheel
as
it
stopped
right
in
my
face
i
got
up
and
out
from
under
it
brushed
myself
off
the
bus
driver
opened
the
door
and
told
me
to
get
on
and
give
him
my
name
and
number
and
that
the
bus
company
would
be
calling
me
most
of
the
girls
on
the
bus
were
legitimately
terrified
and
asked
the
rest
of
the
bus
what
happened
the
guys
on
the
bus
just
replied
with
he
just
got
f
ed
up
for
some
reason
i
tried
to
give
everyone
a
smile
which
just
came
out
awkward
anyway
got
off
the
bus
and
proceeded
to
skate
off
to
murkland
for
class
everyone
on
both
the
right
and
left
sidewalks
still
in
awe
of
what
they
had
seen
watched
me
skate
away
sat
down
next
to
my
buddy
in
class
and
he
asked
me
what's
good
i
said
just
got
hit
by
a
bus
he
said
that
happened
to
me
once
did
a
superman
right
into
the
side
of
one
you
gonna
get
free
tuition
i
laughingly
replied
with
well
it
was
kinda
the
other
way
around
yeah
i
could've
lied
and
gotten
free
tuition
but
then
i
thought
mmm
bettah
not
other
than
a
frayed
outline
on
my
pants
in
the
shape
of
my
cell
phone
bruises
on
my
side
in
the
shape
of
the
rivets
from
the
bus
siding
a
few
cuts
and
a
slightly
bruised
mentality
about
how
well
i
can
cut
emergency
hard
right
hand
turns
on
my
longboard
i
wasn't
going
to
be
a
dick
and
get
that
kid
fired
from
a
sweet
campus
job
besides
i've
decided
that
sticking
to
late
night
cruising
all
over
campus
without
much
traffic
is
way
more
fun
than
being
on
the
pilot
show
for
i
shouldn't
be
alive
unh
edition
753
to
the
girl
that
always
brings
her
laptop
into
the
bathroom
in
the
santa
rosa
dorms
at
absurdly
late
hours
of
the
night
i
have
one
question
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
on
your
computer
that
is
so
pressing
is
perla
mariela
single
5669
does
anyone
know
the
guy
who
was
dressed
up
as
an
astronaut
on
halloween
are
you
single
i
understand
the
errors
in
generalizing
but
i
can't
help
but
notice
that
on
most
days
i
go
on
a
run
someone
yells
something
usually
obscene
but
sometimes
it's
just
yelling
from
a
car
and
that
the
person
is
always
a
hispanic
male
i
hate
that
i
even
observe
the
race
but
i
do
and
i
can
attest
that
it
is
always
hispanic
i
know
plenty
of
wonderful
wholesome
kind
hispanic
people
who
would
never
do
this
but
still
why
does
this
always
happen
i
want
to
excuse
the
behavior
somehow
or
tell
myself
that
i
should
be
cursing
the
action
and
not
the
race
of
person
doing
yelling
and
yet
here
i
am
anonymously
ranting
on
my
liberal
arts
college's
confessions
page
about
my
closeted
racism
dude
what
happened
between
us
just
kiss
me
am
i
too
old
to
be
affected
by
my
the
arguing
between
my
parents
i
feel
like
it
shouldn't
affect
me
so
much
but
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
the
two
people
i
love
most
destroy
and
hurt
each
other
to
such
an
extent
15375
to
my
pakistani
best
friend
we
do
everything
together
i've
had
some
of
the
best
times
in
my
life
in
your
company
yet
at
a
level
my
heart
doesn't
seem
to
trust
that
you
trust
me
the
way
it
should
naturally
too
much
of
a
baggage
of
history
from
our
grandparent's
parents
side
i
imagine
our
nationalities
have
created
this
imaginary
border
which
neither
of
us
can
seem
to
cross
at
a
deeper
level
i
hate
borders
and
nationalism
can
i
get
pregnant
from
putting
my
own
semen
up
my
butt
i
live
on
northside
of
campus
and
whenever
i
walk
to
northgate
or
back
to
my
dorm
i
purposely
avoid
the
walden
boys
why
they
so
strange
can
girls
please
stop
with
the
let's
line
up
topless
but
with
our
backs
to
the
camera
pictures
what's
the
point
does
this
new
red
color
scheme
mean
that
nyu
secrets
has
joined
the
dark
side
and
become
a
sith
lord
should
i
ask
a
girl
i
like
too
midnight
yell
or
would
it
be
creepy
17832
i
am
a
gay
freshman
girl
and
i
want
to
go
to
some
lgbt
parties
how
do
i
get
invited
find
out
about
them
mitra
ghaffari
do
you
date
different
races
i'm
so
tired
of
living
this
double
life
it's
really
time
for
me
to
choose
between
the
two
of
you
but
i
don't
know
if
i
can
the
future
looks
so
promising
with
one
despite
the
ups
and
downs
of
our
relationship
but
the
other
is
unbelievably
fun
to
be
around
in
the
moment
and
i
know
i
can
score
pretty
highly
with
i
knew
one
day
this
ultimatum
would
come
but
i
never
guessed
it
would
happen
so
soon
college
or
flappy
bird
sometimes
on
weekends
i
just
run
as
far
as
i
can
until
i'm
entirely
exhausted
and
then
i
have
to
run
all
the
way
back
sometimes
this
gives
me
the
shits
today
was
one
of
those
days
once
back
on
campus
i
found
the
first
open
building
and
the
nearest
bathroom
while
taking
care
of
this
unfortunate
attack
brought
on
by
my
stomach
someone
else
walks
in
if
there's
one
thing
i
hate
it's
when
people
take
their
sweet
time
in
the
bathroom
waiting
for
everyone
else
to
leave
i
decide
what's
the
worst
that
could
happen
i've
unleashed
this
horror
in
here
but
i
probably
will
never
even
see
this
person
again
needless
to
say
it
was
a
friend
of
mine
awkward
11308
so
i
went
to
becker
house
today
to
check
up
on
my
friend
and
i
saw
the
girl
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
all
this
while
she
was
sitting
in
the
computer
room
near
the
dinning
room
she
has
an
afro
she
is
black
i
remember
she
said
email
me
so
i
was
deciding
whether
to
go
reveal
myself
but
i
am
not
sure
she
likes
white
people
like
myself
she
doesnt
come
off
that
way
to
me
i
was
scared
so
i
walked
away

guess
i
am
a
punk

alllol

the
afro

someone
tell
every
guy
at
this
school
to
stop
with
the
mixed
signals
you
either
like
a
girl
or
you
don't
so
just
make
up
your
mind
it's
so
annoying
jesus
taught
tolerance
god
is
depicted
as
an
omniscient
all
perfect
being
man
wrote
the
bible
from
the
word
of
god
isn't
it
possible
we
didn't
get
the
message
100
clear
when
we
said
let's
hate
the
gays
and
they
will
burn
in
hell
13268
i
know
i
am
walking
with
a
nice
bit
of
honor
and
all
and
everyone
is
celebrating
but
honestly
i
feel
like
i
am
getting
expelled
they
are
kicking
me
out
and
i
just
don't
wanna
go
yet
can
i
get
another
semester
or
two
to
figure
out
who
i
am
when
i
grow
up
we're
too
concerned
about
sex
and
relationships
when
we
should
be
worrying
about
how
the
hell
we're
going
to
lice
5
10
even
20
years
from
now
where
are
the
people
who
are
focused
on
their
future
first
and
that
moment
of
satisfaction
later
excuse
me
for
changing
things
up
but
shit
orgasms
come
and
go
but
herpes
and
bills
are
forever
im
20
year
old
sophomore
and
have
a
thing
for
a
23
year
old
who
has
one
more
semester
left
am
i
wasting
my
time
or
would
some
boys
date
a
girl
that
still
has
2
years
left
of
school
hot
steamy
sex
in
the
scili
on
a
monday
night
check
i
probably
appear
seemingly
calm
and
relaxed
at
ease
with
the
conversation
we're
having
and
the
eye
contact
we
keep
making
but
on
the
inside
i
am
more
nervous
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
be
every
fiber
of
my
being
is
rigid
and
tense
as
if
there
is
some
alien
force
trapped
in
the
foot
between
us
and
i
don't
know
if
i
like
the
unfamiliar
pull
or
not
my
limbs
vibrate
when
i
move
them
into
hopefully
a
natural
position
arms
crossed
no
hands
in
pockets
no
oh
look
my
jacket
zipper
goes
up
and
down
how
fascinating
i
forget
that
its
snowing
and
i
cannot
feel
the
biting
wind
or
my
numb
toes
or
my
aching
hands
i
am
focused
on
how
mechanical
my
body
suddenly
feels
and
how
bewildering
it
is
that
i
cannot
find
a
comfortable
resting
position
all
of
this
is
registered
in
seconds
somehow
i
have
enough
sense
to
listen
to
the
words
leaving
your
mouth
in
case
you
expect
me
to
respond
internally
i
scour
my
brain
for
anything
intelligent
or
relevant
or
appropriate
to
say
but
all
that
comes
out
is
a
nervous
smile
a
forced
gentle
laugh
a
nod
of
the
head
i
hope
you
don't
think
i'm
not
interested
i
keep
looking
over
your
shoulder
at
my
boots
at
the
sidewalk
at
the
passing
cars
at
the
snow
at
your
coat
at
buildings
and
in
that
moment
even
though
its
the
biggest
cliche
in
the
book
it
finally
makes
sense
to
me
how
eye
contact
can
send
a
very
physical
jolt
through
your
body
if
its
with
the
right
person
with
somebody
you
admire
want
in
retrospect
however
i
now
recognize
the
jolt
as
panic
panic
or
fear
that
in
the
few
seconds
you
look
into
my
eyes
everything
i
cannot
say
will
be
available
to
you
and
you'll
do
with
my
feelings
what
you
please
what
i
really
feel
when
we
lock
eyes
is
more
like
molten
lava
spreading
through
my
body
starting
at
my
eyes
and
ending
at
my
fingertips
my
lips
it
is
wonderful
and
terrifying
and
i
hold
on
as
long
as
i
can
until
you
look
away
or
i
do
i
wonder
if
you
feel
it
too
are
we
just
playing
a
silent
game
of
chicken
do
you
stare
at
my
lips
the
way
i
stare
at
yours
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
shape
and
fullness
of
them
are
you
momentarily
wondering
how
they
would
feel
on
mine
maybe
you
don't
your
mouth
doesn't
seem
to
stop
moving
you
keep
talking
and
i
honestly
cannot
hear
you
i'm
trying
desperately
to
be
in
this
moment
with
you
but
it
seems
to
be
going
by
so
slowly
through
my
eyes
and
too
quickly
like
water
flowing
through
my
fingers
mentally
i
am
pleading
with
any
deity
to
stop
us
like
this
because
i
am
afraid
that
this
won't
happen
again
and
that
i
won't
be
able
to
experience
fear
and
admiration
and
nervousness
and
happiness
of
this
caliber
ever
again
13163
my
physical
attractiveness
generally
counterbalances
my
introversion
and
social
awkwardness
but
i
feel
like
i've
missed
many
an
opportunity
with
colleagues
and
classmates
how
should
i
go
about
working
on
this
aside
from
the
obvious
going
out
more
dolce
the
one
who
got
the
award
for
french
girl
it's
so
dumb
when
girls
wear
bikinis
and
lingerie
as
a
costume
then
get
mad
when
guys
whistle
at
them
what
did
they
think
was
going
to
happen
fuck
my
parents
old
ass
doctors
that
want
me
to
major
in
biology
and
then
go
to
medical
school

i
wanna
major
in
business
or
liberal
arts
and
do
something
fun
with
my
life
fuck
treating
rich
people
only
and
turning
away
the
poor
because
they
don't
have
money
and
crushing
people's
dreams
and
ending
people's
lives
and
countless
years
of
school
and
joining
the
illuminati
and
who
knows
what
else
fuck

all
i
don't
like
interracial
porn

me
racist
11313

the
same
house

see
through
my
hey

was
walking
out
of
class
i
overheard
a
guy
asking
and
get
rejected
to
his
frat's
date
party
is
it
just
me
or
is
there
a
warm
satisfaction
in
seeing
a
frat
guy
get
turned
down
usually
the
girls
are
too
drunk
to
know
what
no
means

nice
irish
red

lgbt
ceremony

i
feel
discriminated
against
why
do
these
students
deserve
recognition
based
on
thier
sexual
preference
we

have
a
hetero
sexual
banquet
celebrating
the
achievements
of
our
straight
student
body

already
established
precident
how

caucasian
variety

simple
all

student
thanks
for
making
me
feel
stupid
as
an
aggie
i
do
appreciate
proper
grammar
usage
and
use
it
myself
when
posting
confessions
writing
comments
on
this
page
however
people
who
post
shit
like
learn
some
english
first
or
i
hope
you
don't
go
to
a
m
over
a
few
silly
grammatical
errors
need
to
take
that
shoe
out
of
their
asses
it's
not
that
serious
shiiitttttt
can't
a
nigga
just
confess
these
days
so
what
exactly
do
we
yell
when
the
tigers
make
a
goal
at
a
hockey
game
it
starts
with
an
s
i
think
2571
why
won't
monchen
kao
graze
with
me
people
are
really
closed
minded
about
what
others
do
or
like
if
someone
comes
in
here
and
says
they
don't
like
something
that
is
really
big
in
college
station
or
texas
like
those
people
complaining
about
football
or
aggie
traditions
who
also
seem
closed
minded
and
judgmental
themselves
everyone
jumps
out
and
tells
them
to
get
out
of
the
state
or
even
the
country
as
corny
as
this
may
sound
why
not
just
get
along
with
people
even
if
they
like
or
don't
like
football
soccer
dogs
cats
spicy
food
rock
rap
mustangs
or
hondas
individuality
is
very
good
this
is
a
free
country
and
everyone
can
have
whatever
combination
of
likes
and
dislikes
as
they
fucking
want
human
culture
would
be
very
boring
if
everyone
liked
and
did
the
same
things
15168
last
semester
i
got
bids
from
delta
chi
and
sig
phi
but
didn't
sign
either
now
everyone
treats
me
like
a
gdi
loser
i
wish
there
was
a
way
to
keep
the
social
status
that
comes
with
being
in
a
top
frat
without
actually
being
in
one
why
is
cornell
so
greek
centric
14998
the
way
people
strictly
adhere
to
some
silly
traditions
really
irritates
me
sometimes
actually
no
it's
when
they're
going
to
chastise
me
for
not
doing
eating
something
the
traditional
way
who
says
i'm
trying
to
follow
your
tradition
anyway
i'm
starting
a
tradition
where
i
eat
food
the
way
i
want
it
when
i
want
it
and
if
i
don't
want
anymore
you
f
cking
leave
me
alone
1393
i've
been
working
and
studying
for
the
rest
of
my
midterms
for
pretty
much
the
entirety
of
my
spring
break
with
a
few
breaks
for
reunions
with
my
friends
at
home
so
when
i
see
pictures
of
my
buddies
partying
it
up
on
the
beach
am
i
jealous
sure
but
secretly
i'm
also
sneakily
glad
to
be
getting
the
academic
one
up
on
them
while
they
get
plastered
every
night
and
wake
up
covered
in
confetti
and
vomit
who's
going
out
tonight
holla
1020
my
roommate
and
i
have
an
understanding
that
we
would
respect
one
another
by
not
having
sex
while
the
other
is
in
the
same
room
well
he
came
home
last
night
with
a
girl
and
began
to
bang
while
i
was
awake
i
was
furious
as
can
be
until
he
shot
his
load
and
she
started
freaking
out
he
thought
she
was
on
birth
control
but
it
turns
out
she
wasn't
and
he
wasn't
wearing
mr
rubber
can
i
hear
k
a
r
m
a
6562
is
there
any
female
who
wanna
be
my
best
friend
i
am
a
guy
and
have
only
guy
best
friends
while
i
have
few
female
friends
but
they
are
into
their
own
thingies
you
may
find
me
shy
at
first
but
i
can
tell
you
that
i
will
offer
you
the
best
friendship
ever
and
make
you
laugh
all
the
time
come
on
now
gurlyss
there
are
tons
of
great
things
about
a
m
and
about
texas
in
general
but
as
soon
as
i
graduate
i'm
gonna
have
to
flee
to
a
state
and
an
area
that
doesn't
have
to
be
dragged
kicking
and
screaming
into
modernity
and
if
this
school
didn't
have
so
many
backwards
people
straight
resource
center
and
the
student
senate
bill
to
opt
out
of
about
50
cents
worth
of
fees
that
goes
to
help
an
oppressed
minority
anyone
not
to
mention
the
numerous
creationists
i've
met
it
would
be
absolutely
amazing
as
it
is
i
kind
of
wish
i
had
gone
somewhere
else
are
we
not
supposed
to
walk
over
the
seal
on
military
walk
are
people
confusing
this
with
the
seal
in
the
academic
building
that
is
actually
blocked
off
464
to
the
guys
that
used
to
walk
around
campus
in
the
white
robes
late
night
i
honestly
idolize
you
that's
the
type
of
fun
random
shit
you
do
in
college
but
being
at
pepperdine
i
would
be
terrified
of
the
judgement
and
having
an
encounter
with
dps
i'm
just
a
freshman
guy
who
wants
friends
to
do
random
stupid
things
like
that
with
and
make
college
memorable
that
can't
be
too
much
to
ask
for
right
please
come
save
me
from
my
boring
life
on
upper
dorm
road
how
did
yall
know
you
were
in
love
with
your
significant
other
like
when
did
it
hit
you
6242
hey
architecture
boys
will
one
of
you
leave
the
studio
long
enough
to
help
me
with
my
seven
9236
is
okay
to
use
the
morning
after
pill
twice
like
if
i
took
one
2
years
ago
and
now
i
need
to
take
one
again
does
cc
have
partnerships
for
online
classes
my
friend
complains
about
students
whose
parents
pay
all
their
rent
yet
her
parents
pay
half
her
rent
and
i'm
over
here
paying
all
of
my
rent
so
can
i
slap
her
now
yours
was
the
biggest
i
ever
sucked
ever
and
it
only
happened
one
time
and
for
some
reason
i
never
told
you
so
maybe
i
was
just
too
eager
about
it
to
say
something
too
bad
i'll
probably
never
encounter
your
beautiful
member
again
11000
i
don't
understand
the
complaints
about
ilr
stats
isn't
that
supposed
to
be
the
easiest
stats
class
don't
you
get
a
formula
sheet
for
every
exam
i
don't
understand
how
anyone
can
complain
about
the
class
when
it's
giving
a
lot
more
leeway
than
every
other
stats
class
you
don't
want
me
shoving
my
religion
in
your
face
don't
shove
your
homosexuality
in
mine
i
think
it's
wrong
it's
your
right
to
make
that
choice
but
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
it
biologically
it
does
nothing
for
our
species
the
physical
act
of
sodomy
is
horrendously
disgusting
if
you
take
2
seconds
to
think
about
it
objectively
and
that
sort
of
lifestyle
leads
to
a
very
high
incidence
of
stds
no
amount
of
propaganda
marches
or
lgbt
centers
can
change
this
do
what
you
want
but
quit
trying
to
force
me
to
accept
it
one
man
one
woman
that
is
clearly
the
way
that
god
or
nature
intended
it
that's
the
pillar
of
the
survival
of
our
species
the
creation
of
life
so
that's
what
i'll
support
and
one
more
question
for
gay
marriage
supporters
before
i
go
if
10
consenting
people
all
love
each
other
and
consent
to
marry
do
you
support
their
right
to
all
marry
each
other
if
not
why
not
who
are
you
to
tell
these
ten
people
what
they
can
do
with
their
lives
to
deny
them
their
rights
what
about
20
people
30
turns
out
we
all
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
just
draw
it
where
nature
put
it
1944
no
i'm
not
on
a
diet
and
it's
not
totally
awesome
that
i'm
so
thin
i
have
an
illness
called
crohn's
disease
that
keeps
me
from
digesting
food
normally
it
is
not
fun
and
it
gets
worse
every
year
i'm
self
conscious
about
my
weight
and
my
food
because
it
means
i'm
sick
you
saying
you're
envious
of
my
willpower
is
just
dumb
and
makes
me
feel
weird
just
because
i'm
thin
doesn't
make
it
polite
to
focus
so
hard
on
what
my
body
looks
like
just
talk
to
me
about
drama
or
joss
whedon
or
cute
cats
k
duuude
when
is
lax
throwing
down
again
i
wanna
go
back
to
space
iwantthed
i
had
an
abortion
9
months
ago
and
i
felt
secure
in
the
decision
at
the
time
i
mean
it
was
with
a
fleeting
hookup
who
was
second
best
to
someone
else
at
the
time
since
the
abortion
i've
fallen
in
love
with
that
person
i
feel
empty
and
frustrated
it's
hard
to
get
out
of
bed
it's
hard
to
go
to
sleep
am
i
mourning
the
loss
of
my
unborn
child
or
the
relationship
that
i
should
have
allowed
to
blossom
i
ended
that
the
real
question
is
what
do
i
do
about
it
now
was
on
a
class
trip
to
galway
a
few
years
ago
for
halloween
and
a
few
of
us
went
out
as
a
hen
party
ended
up
in
some
girls
house
outside
the
city
next
morning
i
faced
the
choice
of
walking
the
length
of
eyre
square
and
shop
street
back
to
the
hostel
dressed
in
my
hen
outfit
or
just
my
adidas
short
shorts
in
my
confused
state
i
chose
the
shorts
and
left
my
sisters
heels
cue
the
coldest
walk
of
shame
of
my
life
anymore
class
trip
stories
keep
em
coming

i
was
just
officially
offered
my
spot
abroad
next
year
which
is
necessary
to
meet
my
graduation
requirements
as
a
global
liberal
studies
student
my
excitement
was
quickly
dashed
however
upon
seeing
that
in
order
to
secure
said
spot
abroad
a
500
dollar
deposit
is
recommended
before
march
15th
no
one
ever
mentioned
to
us
that
that
would
be
a
condition
of
acceptance
and
who
gives
a
person
less
than
two
weeks
to
find
that
kind
of
lump
of
cash
this
was
a
graduation
requirement
of
my
major
not
my
own
whimsical
want
to
spend
another
year
out
of
the
country
though
granted
i
am
excited
and
fortunate
for
the
opportunity
and
the
fact
that
they
casually
hit
us
up
over
and
over
for
more
money
is
disgusting
i
am
willing
to
put
myself
at
financial
risk
and
take
out
the
loans
necessary
to
go
here
but
random
last
minute
emails
hitting
me
up
for
money
at
such
short
notice
is
absolutely
ridiculous
i
don't
even
feel
comfortable
mentioning
this
to
my
parents
are
they
supposed
to
not
feed
my
siblings
and
or
skip
a
mortgage
payment
because
nyu
is
trying
to
shake
the
money
tree's
trunk
some
more
why
is
it
that
thirteen
embassy
attacks
happened
under
gwb
costing
us
dozens
of
lives
and
republicans
didn't
give
two
shits
but
an
incident
happens
in
benghazi
costing
us
four
lives
and
they
are
ready
to
impeach
the
president
over
it
and
let's
not
even
talk
about
how
the
iraq
war
which
was
based
on
a
lie
cost
us
"4,000"
lives
and
who
knows
how
many
innocent
iraqi
civilians
i
don't
agree
with
liberals
on
everything
hell
i
was
willing
to
vote
for
rubio
over
clinton
in
2016
but
the
republicans
have
become
such
slimy
hypocrites
and
they
have
gone
so
far
right
that
i
can't
even
stomach
the
thought
of
voting
for
them
anymore
and
to
the
genius
who
said
that
democrats
favor
unrestricted
welfare
and
that's
why
they
get
votes
it
was
actually
bill
clinton
who
passed
welfare
reform
which
drastically
limited
the
size
and
scope
of
the
benefits
people
could
receive
now
about
4
of
the
population
is
on
welfare
whereas
52
of
the
population
voted
democrat
in
the
last
election
people
don't
vote
democrat
because
they
are
getting
government
goods
they
vote
democrat
because
too
many
republicans
are
uninformed
extremists

a
guy
i
had
over
once
peed
on
my
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
guess
the
bathroom
would
have
been
too
much
of
a
challenge
i
don't
know
we've
never
talked
about
it
and
a
part
of
me
wonders
if
you
even
remember
another
part
of
me
wonders
if
you
think
you
were
so
ninja
in
cleaning
it
up
because
yeah
i
didn't
find
anything
on
my
desk
the
next
morning
but
over
the
next
few
days
i
lifted
up
things
and
shit
was
wet
this
is
me
calling
you
out
weirdooo

i
was
at
a
party
last
weekend
this
kid
there
was
walking
up
to
people
saying
you
in
a
frat
i'm
in
a
frat
come
at
me
bro
the
fuck
here's
a
message
for
all
you
badass
fratters
here
being
in
a
frat
means
nothing
absolutely
nothing
you
are
no
better
tougher
smarter
stronger
or
superior
to
anybody
simply
for
being
in
a
frat
you
think
your
fake
brotherhood
sets
you
above
me
you
call
these
guys
your
brothers
when
nothing
in
particular
even
brought
you
together
besides
a
bit
of
hazing
that
you
went
through
after
you
decided
you
wanted
to
join
these
guys
big
deal
you
share
nothing
special
no
talents
goals
interests
etc
that
brought
you
together
with
the
exception
of
certain
frats
that
are
restricted
to
certain
majors
ethnicities
etc
you
simply
decided
one
day
that
you
wanted
to
join
a
group
of
guys
that
you
couldn't
even
meet
by
natural
means
i
played
football
in
hs
busting
my
ass
with
my
teammates
every
day
of
the
season
going
through
hell
so
that
we
can
go
to
war
together
on
friday
nights
that's
an
example
of
a
real
brotherhood
that's
an
example
of
true
brothers
coming
together
and
having
each
others
backs
to
reach
an
accomplishment
that
we
all
seek
because
we
share
talent
and
interest
this
doesn't
apply
to
all
frat
guys
in
fact
it
probably
applies
to
the
minority
but
those
of
you
in
frats
who
have
the
mentality
that
you
are
better
than
anyone
else
because
you
decided
to
gain
a
brotherhood
by
default
it's
time
you
realize
how
ridiculous
your
mentality
is
and
realize
your
ego
just
makes
you
look
like
a
pathetic
fool
i
am
an
egyptian
guy
and
i
am
having
a
hard
time
meeting
girls
that
are
interested
in
me
is
it
because
of
my
race
or
am
i
not
being
open
enough
this
happens
in
general
with
making
white
friends
nothing
against
minorities
i
just
feel
like
texas
a
m
is
split
between
whites
and
non
whites
guys
what
are
some
sweet
sexy
things
that
your
girlfriend
can
do
for
you
my
boyfriend
always
does
so
much
for
me
i
would
like
to
do
something
to
surprise
him
in
return
also
do
not
tell
me
to
do
him
this
already
happens
on
a
regular
basis
why
is
it
hard
to
find
coke
at
this
school
all
i
want
for
my
last
semester
is
a
steady
connect
and
a
friend
who
loves
to
put
things
up
his
her
nose
i
don't
discriminate
officer
how
high
are
you
me
no
officer
its
hi
how
are
you
when
i
came
to
college
i
really
wanted
to
experiment
with
girls
too
but
they
are
no
where
to
be
seen
where
are
the
beautiful
hot
ones
maybe
i'm
just
too
picky

admin
is
this
the
same
admin
as
yesterday
admin
edit
yes
i
am
my
confession
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
went
through
a
major
bout
of
depression
i
felt
alone
scared
and
i
could
feel
myself
drowning
but
every
time
i
tried
to
scream
for
help
i
felt
like
someone
had
put
my
voice
on
mute
and
no
sounds
could
escape
my
throat
around
friends
i
was
always
smiling
and
laughing
because
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
what
they
want
from
me
i'm
the
happy
go
lucky
one
in
the
group
if
i
can't
provide
my
usual
cheery
attitude
than
what
do
i
really
have
to
offer
eventually
my
self
loathing
became
so
severe
that
i
thought
maybe
it
would
be
just
better
if
i
killed
myself
i
was
so
sure
that
i
had
become
nothing
more
than
a
burden
to
those
around
me
that
i
thought
why
do
i
even
exist
i'm
nothing
more
than
dead
weight
my
very
presence
is
a
punishment
to
those
around
me
if
i
truly
cared
for
them
than
i
should
do
them
the
favor
of
ending
myself
so
as
to
stop
being
such
a
nuisance
in
their
lives
my
self
hatred
had
become
so
powerful
that
i
thought
the
most
productive
thing
i
could
do
in
this
world
was
to
terminate
my
existence
but
i
could
never
have
been
more
wrong
than
i
was
then
i
have
so
much
to
offer
in
this
world
i
am
la
oving
brother
an
amazing
son
a
wonderful
partner
in
life
a
splendid
friend
who
puts
others
before
himself
and
a
fucking
phenomenal
individual
who
is
nowhere
near
done
showing
the
world
what
the
hell
he
can
accomplish
and
while
coming
to
that
realization
was
a
difficult
process
it
was
possible
thanks
to
the
support
and
care
of
loving
family
and
friends
a
wonderful
therapist
who
listened
to
me
and
never
tried
to
belittle
my
experience
shout
out
to
butler
hospital
and
medication
that
while
stigmatized
is
so
helpful
because
depression
is
a
biological
process
and
often
times
is
best
treated
with
a
combination
of
therapy
and
medication
so
i
want
to
leave
this
message
for
those
who
are
currently
struggling
with
depression
you
are
all
so
amazing
so
talented
so
beautiful
inside
and
out
and
the
world
has
only
just
begin
to
see
how
brilliant
you
are
so
please
don't
question
your
place
in
this
world
you
are
wonderful
and
you
are
loved
i
love
you
i
don't
know
you
but
i
love
you
because
you
are
a
unique
individual
with
a
special
story
to
tell
and
i
want
to
hear
that
story
so
if
you
ever
feel
like
you're
questioning
your
existence
please
seek
help
whether
its
from
a
friend
colleague
or
medical
professional
because
no
one
deserves
to
endure
the
struggle
of
depression
especially
not
alone
i
promise
you
that
it
does
get
better
i
am
a
survivor
and
i
know
you
are
too
so
fight
and
never
back
down
and
show
depression
that
you
are
powerful
and
fierce
and
you
cannot
be
defeated

anyone

get
caught
in
an
endless
loop
of
depression
you
feel
bad
about
something
but
then
feel
even
worse
for
feeling

because
there
are
so
many
people
in
the
world
worse
off
than
you
i
recently
added
admin_chronos
on
snapchat
but
i'm
to
shy
to

really
know
what
to
send

snaps
of
any
suggestions
ladies
or
gents

fill
in
the
blanks
anyways
i
would
really
appreciate
the
recommendations
13459
staying
in
ithaca
over
the
summer
was
one
of
the
worst
decisions
i
made
i
can't
go
home
now
and
ditch
my
internship
though
everyday
i
just
go
to
work
come
home
eat
food
watch
t.v
masturbate
sleep
and
then
repeat
seriously
is
there
anything
else
to
do
here
i
also
miss
having
sex
2277
why
is
it
so
hard
to
find
a
man
to
smoke
weed
with
bro
out
with
and
have
sex
with
on
a
regular
basis
i
know
cornell
is
stressing
you
boys
out
too
so
why
not
help
each
other
blow
some
steam
off
and
unwind
when
the
person
you
really
like
a
lot
unfriends
you
on
facebook
do
you
take
that
seriously
10100
what
the
heck
is
all
this
cornell
bashing
you
guys
realize
we
are
easily
top
20
in
the
world
yeah
harvard
and
princeton
are
better
but
that's
like
saying
michael
bloomberg
is
worth
30
billion
less
than
warren
buffet
so
he's
poor
you're
making
it
sound
like
we're
arizona
state
ffs
we're
getting
pounded
enough
in
popular
culture
we
don't
need
it
from
you
i
say
love
it
or
leave
it
being
isolated
has
its
advantages
it's
a
great
learning
environment
and
we
have
a
tightly
knit
community
you
think
the
dating
scene
is
tough
here
try
competing
with
new
york
city
or
boston
we
also
have
the
best
natural
surroundings
and
the
cleanest
air
not
to
mention
we'll
be
the
only
ivy
league
school
left
once
the
coast
is
underwater
come
to
cornell
kids
its
an
amazing
place
especially
if
you
worked
hard
to
get
here
and
didnt
come
from
privilege
5121
i
want
to
get
my
first
tattoo
any
suggestions
as
to
where
to
go
in
ithaca
someone
explain
to
me
the
whole
texas
a
m
thing
there
are
several
campuses
but
only
a
very
few
who
can
have
the
aggie
ring
so
when
you
go
to
an
employer
do
you
say
i
went
to
texas
a
m
or
do
you
say
i
went
to
texas
a
m
kingsville
galveston
commerce
killeen
san
antonio
texarkana
etc
because
it
seems
the
most
prestigious
one
is
at
college
station
i
know
most
campuses
have
different
rings
too
and
i
find
that
sucks
but
goes
to
show
you
have
to
prove
you
can
actually
get
into
the
best
one
or
be
geographically
able
to
attend
that
campus
to
deserve
the
best
ring
or
most
honorable
ring
first
year
self
thoughts
i
would
never
use
spark
notes
a
book
for
comps
its
comps
isn't
it
really
important
senior
year
self
thoughts
i
can't
deal
with
this
time
period
anymore
its
time
for
spark
notes
my
insomnia
is
ruining
my
life
and
i
mean
it
when
i
say
insomnia
a
lot
of
people
use
it
to
mean
they
stay
up
until
3
00
am
watching
netflix
every
night
but
i
mean
that
i
literally
cannot
fall
asleep
at
all
during
the
night
sometimes
multiple
nights
in
a
row
it's
giving
me
health
problems
and
making
me
too
exhausted
to
do
anything
or
care
about
anything
i
know
there
must
be
some
people
who
are
going
through
or
have
gone
through
the
same
thing
what
do
i
do
how
can
i
make
it
better
i've
tried
things
like
meditation
breathing
relaxation
as
well
as
sleeping
pills
but
nothing
has
consistently
worked
and
no
smoking
pot
does
not
help
much
sadly
any
and
all
advice
would
be
appreciated
8382
is
there
anyone
here
who
was
depressed
but
somehow
got
out
of
it
i
just
want
things
to
go
back
to
normal
and
there's
no
reason
for
me
to
be
depressed
i'm
just
tired
all
the
damn
time
even
though
i
sleep
so
long
every
night
and
i
want
enough
energy
to
get
through
the
day
does
it
bother
anyone
else
that
there's
only
one
way
in
and
one
way
out
to
the
dimond
it's
like
the
mafia
maybe
all
the
recent
queer
talk
is
getting
to
my
head
but
i
feel
like
you've
given
me
odd
looks
as
we
pass
each
other
to
from
worner
are
you
interested
or
avoiding
i'm
not
totally
out
either
if
you
are
interested
which
also
goes
for
it
you're
not
i
recently
started
liking
this
girl
and
i
want
to
ask
her
on
a
date
she's
23
and
i'm
20
is
this
too
much
of
an
age
difference
i
see
some
people
comment
on
here
that
someone
is
a
troll
how
can
you
tell
i
usually
click
their
profile
picture
and
they
don't
look
like
a
troll
well
not
all
the
time
alabama
is
now
the
new
rival
of
a
m
there
is
no
doubt
anymore
so
can
we
start
a
tradition
of
a
m
and
alabama
facing
each
other
on
thanksgiving
i
still
long
for
you
your
kisses
your
surprised
face
your
face
in
general
your
voice
and
your
company
i
wonder
do
you
miss
me
at
all
2241
so
at
what
point
does
college
become
fun
instead
of
just
super
stressful
and
busy
why
the
fuck
is
it
always
so
windy
here
i
thought
we
were
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
not
the
university
of
fucking
chicago
11569
these
are
first
world
problems
cause
many
3rd
world
people
would
think
we're
fucking
crazy
they
would
be
like
you
guys
can
secure
a
job
housing
and
food
right
now
yet
you
still
subject
yourself
to
large
amounts
of
stress
cause
you
want
more
17482
i
feel
that
any
problem
that
isn't
academic
is
automatically
downgraded
by
other
people
if
i
have
family
trouble
money
problems
large
medical
problems
etc
others
will
just
say
well
i
have
two
prelims
this
week
and
x
amount
of
problem
sets
and
i
am
struggling
way
more
than
you
even
if
i
explain
the
severity
of
my
problem
and
why
it
is
actually
time
consuming
if
i
stop
going
to
club
frat
events
drop
a
class
or
i'm
not
in
research
i
leave
because
i
need
to
deal
with
non
academic
problems
people
think
i
have
a
lot
of
free
time
now
and
have
it
easy
because
i
only
have
a
few
classes
to
worry
about
some
of
my
friends
even
give
me
dirty
looks
when
i
tell
them
i
need
to
leave
to
actually
eat
or
sleep
what
a
shocker
who
does
that
so
i
can
handle
my
stress
better
150
is
it
sad
that
i
can
tell
which
of
my
housemates
is
having
sex
based
on
their
moans
10683
i
hate
the
word
prefrosh
y
r
they
called
prefrosh
i
asked
before
but
no
one
gave
an
answer
i
bet
these
so
called
prefrosh
don't
even
know
y
they're
called
that
in
the
words
of
the
baboon
from
the
lion
king
you
don't
even
know
who
you
are
2644
being
of
mixed
race
race
itself
has
never
been
an
indicator
of
attractiveness
to
me
and
all
my
life
i've
dated
guys
of
different
races
i
am
mixed
but
i
appear
more
black
than
anything
and
since
coming
here
i
seem
to
only
attract
black
guys
which
is
fine
and
everything
but
is
that
my
only
option
are
non
black
cornell
guys
generally
not
attracted
to
black
girls
or
something
i
don't
get
it
so
there's
a
guy
i
would
like
to
go
to
midnight
yell
with
should
i
go
ahead
and
ask
him
or
are
girls
not
supposed
to
ask
guys
hmm
are
plus
size
clothing
lines
offensive
why
can't
clothing
brands
just
make
more
sizes
available
why
does
it
have
to
be
xs
s
m
and
l
anything
above
that
needs
its
own
section
i
don't
understand
it
creates
yet
another
unnecessary
divide
i
just
typed
a
very
obscurely
worded
homework
question
into
google
and
three
words
in
it
became
the
suggested
search
how
long
does
a
professor
have
to
assign
the
same
exact
homework
for
it
to
be
searched
enough
to
be
a
suggestion
glad
to
know
he's
really
keeping
up
with
the
times
15376
it
used
to
bother
me
that
that
one
morally
self
righteous
girl
posted
on
every
confession
now
i'm
annoyed
that
a
whiny
and
disrespectful
fan
of
anime
has
replaced
her

do
people

the
need

i've
grown
to
become
a
tolerant
accepting
person
but
the
one
thing
that
truly
bewilders
me
are
those
people
who
use
the
elevator
to
go
up
down
one
floor
is
it
truly
that
much
time
and
energy
to
walk

i
love
to

would
want

only
wanting
him
for
that

football
tickets
i'm
a
senior
as
well
so
i
pull
mondays

own
without
boot
chasing
so
i
don't
care
about
that
corps

really
could
care
less
about
that

prove
it
thanks

everyone
knows
that
ben

are
stewards
right
how
many
people
have
signed
their
lease
at
northpoint
it
seems
like
all
the
rich
kids
are
going
to
live
there
and
have
their
own
clique
and
i
don't
want
to
be
the
odd
one
out
so
i
was
walking
by
tech
today
and
even
though
the
sky
was
completely
clear
a
pretty
heavy
stream
of
rain
fell
on
my
head
it
also
kind
of
stunk
which
also
weird

is
it
weird
that
a

apply

hey
fellow
badgers
looking
for
housing
near

i
find
it
completely
ridiculous
how
much
out
of
state
tuition
is
it's
all
a
load
of
shit
twice
as
much
as
if
i
had
graduated
from
a
high
school
in
texas
where's
the
logic
in
that
if
i
choose
to
come
to
school
here
you'll
get
just
as
much
in
tax
money
as
you
would
if
i
was
a
resident
which
now
i
am
and
have
been
for
three
years
loftin
sharp
and
the
regents
your
logic
on
basically
everything
is
completely
ridiculous
my
5
yr
old
nephew
could
run
this
university
better
than
you
all
have
done
i've
had
sex
with
four
guys
in
my
lifetime
i'm
twenty
is
that
a
lot
i
hate
the
fact
that
the
people
i
live
with
stay
up
and
sleep
in
so
late
i'm
the
one
who
gets
woken
up
by
their
drunken
behavior
at
3
in
the
morning
but
yelled
at
for
getting

for

says
really
does
anyone

like
peeing
on

to
the
brown
kid
on
north
who
has
a
red
backpack
that
has
some
kind
of
racket
sticking
out
of
it
where
have
you
been
this
semester
sincerely
your
stalker
s
why
was
there
an
ambulance
at
the
hockey
house
the
other
night
i
used
to
cut
in
high
school
i
have
scars
on
my
arms
and
can't
hide
them
because
corps
uniform
makes
it
impossible
to
always
have
my
forearms
covered
there's
a
girl
in
my
outfit
who
went
to
high
school
with
me
and
knows
that
i
was
extremely
depressed
and
suicidal
and
hate
my
scars
now
that
i'm
better
yet
all
the
time
she
jokes
about
my
cuts
and
brings
attention
to
them
i
really
want
her
to
stop
but
she's
really
sensitive
and
will
most
likely
try
to
turn
the
outfit
on
me
if
i
say
it
wrong
what
should
i
do
the
people
who
support
gay
marriage
stating
that
we
should
not
impose
our
personal
beliefs
on
other
people
are
the
same
people
opposing
polygamy
if
gay
marriage
becomes
legal
why
make
polygamy
illegal
what
gives
you
the
right
to
tell
people
they
cannot
practice
polygamy
then
police
arrested
a
man
who
was
caught
in
a
mcdonalds
drive
thru
wearing
no
pants
and
fondling
himself
he
was
charged
with
one
count
of
lovin
itmy
question
is
did
he
order
a
fappy
meal

assholes
i
don't
care
about
your
lives
or
for
your
company
but
you

at
least
attempt
to
not
be
completely
disrespectful
and
immature
stop
destroying
the
property
of
other
people
stop
throwing
servery
plates
in
the
trash
stop
making
damages
that
will
not
come
out
of
your
pockets
just
stop
it
it's
pathetic
calm
down
the
completely
unwarranted
ego
and
realize
that
your
existence
is
completely
inconsequential
to
anyone
k
and
if
i
did
give
the
slightest
inkling
of
a
fuck
about
you

i
would
pity

you
think
you're

but
your
dick

because
you
just
got
hit
by
my
acid
constricted
or
hit
with
posion
sting
you
see
i'm
the
king
the
baddest
of
bad
the
illest
all
the
niggas
in
the
sea
wish
they
could
kill
this
now
i
hope
you've
enjoyed
these

up
your
rump
get
your
ass
prepared

if
you're
interested
in
the
guy
and
you
know
he
isn't
the
shy
type
don't
text
him
first
don't
refrain
refrain
little
bitch
refrain
if
he's
one
of
those
confident
borderlining
cocky
guys
then
he
would
text
you
if
he
wanted
to
talk
to
you
but
he
doesn't
besides
who
wants
to
get
to
know
someone
over
text
anyway
can
we
call
that
lame
get
your
fucking
hands
off
that
fucking
phone
you
wimp
of
a
soulmuncher
why
is
everyone
hating
on
kanye
west
now
didn't
anyone
forget
he
made
the
college
dropout
so
honest
question
do
you
have
to
be
in
the
corps
to
be
a
yell
leader
i
have
been
getting
mixed
responses
thanks
gig'em
i
have
strong
feelings
for
a
girl
who
has
a
boyfriend
we
go
on
date
nights
and
see
each
other
often
she's
said
that
she
likes
me
more
than
a
friend
as
well
but
still
hasn't
left
her
boyfriend
i'm
starting
to
get
tired
of
this
back
and
forth
i'm
not
desperate
for
a
relationship
but
at
the
same
time
i
hate
being
in
limbo
time
to
move
on
howdy
ags
first
semester
is
over
and
pretty
much
feeling
like
a
failure
right
now
i
didn't
go
out
and
party
all
the
time
or
skip
class
or
any
of
that
but
i'm
still
going
to
end
up
with
2
d's
this
semester
and
i'm
pretty
bummed
about
it
my
parents
sure
as
hell
aren't
going
to
be
happy
about
it
but
what
can
you
do
right
live
and
learn
i
guess
hopefully
this
won't
put
me
too
far
behind
in
my
major
but
i
guess
time
will
tell
what
motivates
you
to
workout
well
stephen
spears
i
am
definitely
a
girl
and
i
am
sure
you
are
quite
sexy
but
if
i
friend
requested
you
it
would
make
it
too
obvious
and
now
that
you
are
both
back
in
the
running
shall
i
propose
a
fight
for
my
affections
or
one
of
you
could
declare
you
true
love
for
me
and
meet
me
at
the
grill
for
breakfast
one
day
p
6388
i
have
so
much
work
to
do
and
i've
done
none
of
it
over
spring
break
i've
no
idea
how
i
plan
to
do
any
of
it
nor
do
i
have
any
plans
on
how
to
study
for
my
two
exams
right
after
break
ends
but
you
know
what
i'm
full
of
joy
and
determination
and
right
now
i
feel
like
a
million
bucks
yolo
helps
you
sarahze
the
day
but
happiness
and
determination
lets
you
sarahze
life
time
to
work
my
ass
off
so
i
can
be
proud
of
myself
and
stop
living
in
regret
i
have
moments
every
day
where
i
feel
extremely
overjoyed
and
hopeful
and
nothing
can
turn
it
off
i
also
have
moments
every
day
where
i
feel
hopelessly
suicidal
and
nothing
will
make
me
feel
ok
except
waiting
it
out
then
i
have
moments
where
i
feel
like
a
normal
stable
person
whose
just
chilling
maybe
feeling
happy
and
sad
at
the
same
time
but
mostly
feeling
nothing
too
dramatic
what's
my
issue
am
i
just
overthinking
everything
am
i
bipolar
am
i
manic
or
am
i
simply
a
human
being
2711
the
outspoken
feminist
in
my
writing
class
is
so
zealous
about
cataloging
the
ways
men
have
wronged
women
that
i
actually
don't
care
anymore
not
that
i
think
she's
wrong
about
the
patriarchy
rape
culture
etc
quite
the
opposite
it's
just
that
she's
so
relentless
and
heavy
handed
that
it
makes
me
want
to
break
up
with
my
girlfriend
and
never
talk
to
another
woman
again
let
alone
work
towards
equal
rights
is
it
too
much
to
ask
that
feminists
find
a
way
of
making
it
fun
to
care
about
what
they
say
right
or
wrong
you
catch
more
flies
with
honey
than
vinegar
sometimes
when
my
eyebrows
need
a
mending
i
use
the
tools
from
my
dissection
kit
i
can't
be
the
only
one
right
after
showing
my
boyfriend
the
confession
about
the
girl
whose
boyfriend
ate
the
cake
balls
instead
of
her
me
well
no
shit
they're
cake
balls
boyfriend
oh
i
would
be
down
on
you
in
a
second
i
wouldn't
even
see
the
cake
balls
he
doesn't
like
cake
me
oh
you
wanna
tell
me
that
if
i
was
laying
in
bed
completely
naked
with
peanut
butter
cookies
lining
my
body
you
wouldn't
be
more
tantalized
by
the
cookies
there's
no
way
you
would
pick
me
boyfriend
are
you
kidding
here's
what
i
would
do
i
would
dive
between
your
legs
grab
a
cookie
on
the
way
crush
it
over
your
pussy
and
eat
you
and
cookies
at
the
same
time
boy
did
i
pick
a
winner
i
have
a
hypothesis
and
i
need
help
figuring
out
if
it's
true
in
y'all's
opinion
what
is
the
most
noticeable
car
in
this
town
i'm
possessed
by
something
at
night
i
wake
up
with
blood
under
my
nails
and
scratches
over
my
body
my
body
is
sliced
by
razors
when
i
wake
up
i
can't
remember
anything
besides
a
black
mist
wrapping
my
body
in
my
dreams
should
i
be
blessed
or
holy
watered
i
think
it's
to
far
in
i
can
barely
type
this
without
my
heart
pounding
and
arms
tightening
help
me
religious
or
not
help
my
darkest
secret
i've
never
told
anyone
i
hated
my
exgirlfriends
roommate
she's
was
that
annoying
freshman
mommys
girl
whos
dumb
as
hell
and
is
always
getting
white
trash
wasted
via
her
parent's
credit
card
by
herself
if
she
has
to
after
she
figured
out
how
to
do
her
laundry
and
then
found
out
to
use
detergent
i
took
a
huge
piss
in
her
detergent
bottle
and
shook
it
up
and
you
couldn't
smell
a
thing
now
every
time
she
does
her
laundry
she's
washing
it
with
my
urine
the
perfect
crime
that
lasts
long
after
i
was
gone
little
did
she
know
her
other
roommate
and
i
were
fucking
the
last
4
months
of
it
now
that
was
a
shit
show

to
those

you

that
all

in
this
country
are
currently
legally
required
to
sign
up
for
selective

when
they
turn

if
a
man
who
does
not
register
is
prosecuted
he
could
serve
up
to
5
years
in
prison
and
or
pay
a
"250,000"
fine
and
while
this
is
rare
there
are
other
more
likely
penalties
that
the
person
would
have
i
haven't
seen
any
women
fighting
for
equality
to
require
that
all
women
have
to
register
for
this
like
all
men
do
for
true
equality
should't
women
have
to
do
this
does
anyone
else
spend
reading
week
watching
all
of
the
extended
lord
of
the
rings
movies
multiple
times
1453
you
say
you
don't
care
but
you
still
can't
move
on
seriously
get
over
it
so
i
dont
understand
going
to
northgate
and
pay
ridiculous
amount
of
money
just
to
get
some
drink
when
you
can
just
drink
at
your
apartment
with
friends
what
is
the
difference
i
dont
get
how
fun
it
can
be
are
we
all
paying
much
amount
of
money
just
to
tell
others
that
we
are
having
a
good
time
or
staring
at
attractive
people
that
might
appear
every
40minute
also
i
do
not
understand
going
dancing
what
do
guys
do
beside
standing
there
like
an
idiot
and
creepy
or
make
a
fool
out
of
himself
yeah
you
white
boys
all
of
yall
dancing
like
a
squid

ted
mosby
looking
for
the
slutty
pumpkin
me
that
hot
guy
dressed
as
an
astronaut
halloween
night
what's
your
name
more
importantly
are
you
single
sorry
i
kissed
your
cheek
i
just
want
to
be
friends
except
for
the
part
where
i
fuck
you
lets
talk
2943
to
the
tall
really
cute
guy
i
think
your
name
is
alex
in
my
psychology
class
how
do
i
get
you
to
notice
me
look
for
me
some
time
i'll
be
the
girl
staring
at
you
404
i've
always
liked
to
think
of
myself
as
the
nice
guy
but
after
people
get
to
know
me
they
always
tell
me
that
they
thought
i
was
going
to
be
such
a
douchebag
when
they
first
saw
me
they're
quick
to
say
oh
but
you
actually
are
nice
but
i
actually
hate
that
everyone
thinks
i'm
going
to
be
a
huge
dick
because
i
wear
sweatpants
baggy
jeans
a
flatbrim
and
sometimes
timberlands
why
does
the
way
i
dress
automatically
dictate
people's
expectations
of
me
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
being
labeled
a
douche
before
people
ever
know
me
maybe
that
white
kid
that
you
just
think
wants
to
be
black
just
dresses
the
way
he
wants
because
that's
the
style
where
he
grew
up
and
because
it's
comfortable
i
wish
people
wouldn't
be
so
quick
to
label
there's
a
lot
of
damn
butthurt
over
politics
gay
rights
etc
why
can't
we
all
just
live
and
let
live
let
bygones
be
bygones
live
and
let
live
i
was
a
student
athlete
my
senior
year
i
was
raped
by
a
total
stranger
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
was
sober
so
was
my
attacker
i
was
wearing
sweat
pants
and
a
hoodie
i
told
who
i
had
to
for
medical
legal
and
psychological
purposes
the
first
non
essential
person
i
told
my
friend
since
freshman
year
stared
at
me
and
said
you're
so
strong
why
didn't
you
fight
him
off
you're
lying
you're
too
strong
to
get
raped

heard
about
boot
chasers
my
freshman
year
since
then
i
have
worn
my
cowboy
boots
religiously
everyday
for
the
past
3
years

still
haven't
had
any

come
chasing
after
my
boots
what
am
i
doing
wrong

there

but
honestly
i
don't
understand
how
people
can
casually
hook
up
at
parties
if
it's
not
with
somebody
you're
connected
to
emotionally
is
it
really
gratifying
in
response
to
the
post
about
loftin's
departure
being
related
to
some
crazy
conservative
diploma
mill
scheme

bad
peace

where
is
the
line
drawn
between
confidence
and
douchey
overconfidence
i've
become
a
lot
more
confident
in
myself
since
last
year
but
i'm
afraid
now
that
i'm
beginning
to
come
across
as
cocky
overconfident
which
is

always
getting
hardcore
judged
for
being
involved
with
more
than
one
guy
at
the
same
time
not
always
sexually
but
i've
decided
whatever
i
like
to
flirt
and
have
my
fun
and
as
long
as
no
one
is
hurt
in
the
process
and

existentialist
moment
on
42nd

right
now
i'm
sitting
here
watching
people
pass
me
by
and
i'm
wondering
what
i'm
doing
with
my
life
where
am
i

what

has
this
happened
to
anyone
you
write
something
like
a
short
message
telling
someone
you're
in
love
with
that
you
had
a
wonderful
time
at
your
first
date
and
it
seems
like
a
masterpiece
at
the
time
then
you
read
it
a
day
later
and
it
looks
like
a
giant
f
ing
mess
i
hate
my
brain
sweet
or
annoying
what
ever
happened
to
aim
let's
bring
it
back
i
was
sexually
assaulted
and
battered
by
one
of
my
friends
the
last
few
weeks
before
school
started
called
the
police
they
picked
him
up
questioned
me
he
texted
me
the
next
day
when
he
was
bailed
out
by
his
frat
bros
saying
he
was
sorry
and
did
i
have
his
wallet
he
had
the
nerve
i
said
no
buuuuuuut
i
definitely
have
it
it's
in
my
glove
box
in
my
car
with
his
money
and
credit
cards
in
it
just
sitting
there
i'm
not
giving
it
back
prayers
for
the
families
affected

who's
bright
idea
was
it
to
disarm
military
personnel
on
their
own
bases
admin
edit
these
are
tough
times
and
depressing
as
can
be
for
everyone
thoughts
and
prayers
go
a
long
way
as
does
being
there
to
help
anyone
affected
to
the
point
about
the
disarming
however
that
isn't
as
cut
and
dry
to
place
blame
on
any
one
entity
not
entirely
in
the
true
historical
context
at
least
for
our
army
this
originated
with
a
dod
directive
in
1992
over
the
years
the
other
branches
picked
up
similar
initiatives
that
range
from
installation
to
installation
and
the
nature
of
each
one
you
can
look
this
up
on
your
own
but
a
quick
trip
down
history
lane
and
you'll
see
that
this
has
been
a
policy
for
various
military
forces
around
the
world
for
ages
even
as
far
back
as
ancient
greece
where
athenian
hoplites
would
store
their
weaponry
within
the
armory
or
standing
roman
armies
were
not
permitted
within
the
inner
gates
of
rome
if
nothing
else
the
movie
gladiator
made
a
brief
remark
on
this
to
even
arms
being
stored
in
the
castle
armories
in
the
medieval
era
just
the
scale
and
application
of
this
practice
has
varied
over
the
years

the
nice

not

participating

you
want
to

of
whining

about
your

i
used
to
be
a
strict
christian
like
no
sex
before
marriage
but
i'm
becoming
much
more
open
minded
i
haven't
found
a
compassionate
intelligent
person
who's
right
for
me
so
i'm
exploring
friends
with
benefits
people
have
sexual
needs
and
want
to
connect
so
it
makes
sense
to
me
but
i
have
two
questions
1
can
it
be
moral
to
have
sex
without
emotional
intimacy
2
do
people
go
into
friends
with
benefits
willing
to
let
it
turn
into
a
relationship

my

days
when
she
wears
leggings
and
gets
up
in
the
middle
of
class
tits
and
ass
sign
me
up
but
seriously
how
do
i
tell
my
friend
i
wanna
be
fwbs
with
him
admin

hey
so
uh
want
to
be
friends
with
benefits
or
super
awesome
friends
and
get
matching
awesomo
rings
or
hey
want
to
just
casually
hook
up
that
guy
with
the
brand
on
his
arm
last
night
at
1105
super
intimidating
but
also
very
hot
who
is
he
and
how
can
i
get
at
that
could
i
get
the
link
to
the
new
cc
crushes
thanks
not
really
a
confession
but
where
on
campus
can
my
roommate
and
i
go
to
smash
our
pumpkins
and
not
have
to
clean
it
up

what
is
the
name
of
the
waitress
at
sticky
rice
she
is
so
pretty
and
seems
nice
i
recently
helped
a
friend
with
her
midterm
paper
you
know
just
helping
her
with
better
word
choice
grammar
issues
and
smooth
transitions
now
i
really
don't
think
i'm
the
smartest
cookie
on
the
block
but
after
looking
at
her
paper
and
the
help
i've
given
her
throughout
the
year
i
don't
know
how
she
got
in
to
texas
a
m
and
on
top
of
that
i'm
frustrated
she
has
a
nearly
full
ride
here
so
my
two
problems
here
why
did
they
let
someone
who
can
barely
spell
vulnerable
perhaps
and
other
words
i
find
to
be
simple
middle
school
words
into
such
a
high
and
prestigious
public
university
such
as
a
m
and
why
are
they
spending
so
much
money
to
send
her
to
texas
a
m
wouldn't
it
be
easier
for
her
and
her
family
to
do
the
two
years
community
college
then
two
years
at
a
university
like
a
m
i
love
her
as
a
friend
and
i'm
so
happy
to
have
met
her
and
help
her
cause
i
really
do
enjoy
helping
my
friends
when
i
can
but
it
stings
and
i
cringe
each
time
she
makes
middle
school
and
hs
freshman
mistakes
i
want
her
to
succeed
but
at
the
same
i
feel
slighted
by
her
being
here
like
my
degree
here
has
almost
less
value
i've
never
seen
myself
as
above
someone
with
average
intelligence
but
i'm
starting
to
after
only
spending
a
semester
here
tl
dr
op
helped
friend
with
paper
and
hw
and
realized
that
a
m
let
some
pretty
uneducated
people
in
here
op
feels
value
of
a
m
degree
is
decreased
by
people
like
friend
feels
bad
for
thinking
less
of
friend
due
to
being
less
educated
coming
into
college
and
nearly
full
ride
here
anyone
looking
to
join
a
pro
competitive

team

does
the
black

really
unnatural
body
shaming
and
sex

and
i'm
a
little
angry
at
hc
for
it
i
drew
my

version
though
and

it

they
havent
replied
back

i'm
a
fairly
overweight
female
and
i
don't
feel
comfortable
wearing
skimpy
clothes
to
get
guys
i
like
wearing
jeans
and
sweats
is
this
why
guys
don't
even
give
me
a
chance
i've
never
even
been
kissed
this
is
gonna
be
a
long
one
ags
but
i
could
really
use
some
advice
right
now
sp
bear
with
me
please
so
back
in
my
sophmore
yr
there
was
this
girl
in
the
same
major
that
i
was
talking
to
and
was
really
into
it
was
the
start
of
the
semester
and
i
had
just
switched
dorms
and
i
had
this
new
roommate
who
was
a
transfer
he
seemed
kinda
shy
and
antisocial
at
first
so
being
a
good
ag
i
was
trying
to
make
him
get
to
know
people
and
feel
more
comfortable
anyway
so
one
evening
when
im
having
dinner
with
my
roommate
wild
chance
up
comes
this
girl
i'm
into
and
she
decides
to
join
us
for
dinner
and
so
we're
talking
and
i
don't
wanna
be
rude
so
i
include
my
roommate
in
the
conversation
and
whatnot
we
start
talking
about
northgate
bars
and
going
out
on
weekends
and
she
mentions
she's
never
been
to
harry's
so
i'm
like
well
there's
a
concert
this
friday
so
we
should
totally
go
and
she's
down
with
it
and
i'm
thinking
the
perfect
opportunity
just
fell
in
my
lap
unfortunately
the
wannabe
good
ag
in
me
had
to
invite
my
roommate
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
downfall
so
we
all
go
to
harry's
and
we're
enjoying
ourselves
she
and
i
are
talking
even
more
and
again
i'm
trying
not
to
have
him
feel
like
a
third
wheel
so
i'm
being
inclususive
dumbass
me
because
it
turns
out
him
and
her
are
actually
from
the
same
area
and
so
they
actually
have
some
stuff
in
common
and
all
that
and
they
start
hitting
it
off
the
reason
i'm
sharing
this
is
fast
forward
to
today
and
the
two
have
now
been
dating
almost
a
year
and
i've
been
friendzoned
at
first
i
was
cool
with
it
but
the
only
problem
is
that
since
we're
the
same
major
she
and
i
have
seen
each
other
consistently
over
the
semesters
being
in
same
classes
and
all
we've
gotten
close
to
the
point
that
we're
really
good
friends
but
i
also
know
now
for
sure
that
i'm
in
love
with
her
and
this
being
our
last
year
i
want
to
tell
her
so
bad
i
don't
want
to
just
be
a
douche
and
ruin
their
relationship
but
i
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
i
pretty
much
led
the
love
of
my
life
into
another
guys
arms
and
i
don't
know
how
to
just
get
over
her
when
i
see
her
and
talk
to
her
all
the
time
like
we
text
each
other
study
together
go
eat
together
even
meet
up
on
northgate
from
time
to
time
she's
like
an
integral
part
of
my
life
and
i
don't
know
if
i
can
just
cut
her
out
of
it
the
worst
part
is
she
seems
completely
oblivious
to
my
feelings
and
that's
why
i
want
to
tell
her
so
badly
but
if
i
do
i'm
pretty
sure
it'll
completely
ruin
whatever
friendship
we
have
and
i'm
not
sure
i
can
handle
that
on
the
other
hand
i'm
not
sure
i
can
handle
not
telling
her
my
feelings
any
longer
what
should
i
do
15746
i'm
starting
to
feel
the
tolls
of
being
a
flickering
apparition
not
whole
just
constantly
fading
in
and
out
i
used
to
just
smoke
weed
hashoil
for
recreation
sporadically
now
i
smoke
for
self
medication
constantly
i
read
a
letter
today
from
the
strangers
project
about
a
man
dealing
with
the
pain
of
having
a
wife
go
through
a
miscarriage
and
i
broke
down
couldn't
help
it
i'm
only
21
and
thought
i
had
a
positively
bright
future
ahead
of
me
i
found
the
perfect
woman
and
then
chaos
found
us
and
killed
a
part
of
us
what
is
this
memory
going
to
mean
to
me
20
years
from
now
will
it
haunt
me
as
it
does
now
what
will
i
mean
to
her
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
told
me
that
there
was
a
time
when
she
wanted
to
marry
me
and
i've
wanted
to
marry
her
since
our
4th
date
2
years
ago
but
now
she
feels
we're
incompatible
and
she
needs
someone
older
and
more
mature
but
the
subtext
was
clear
she
can't
see
me
without
thinking
about
it
i
can't
think
about
classes
but
i
know
i
must
i
am
sad
and
angry
at
my
inability
to
do
anything
anymore
how
do
people
move
on

pandey
prashant
is
he
single
or
what
i
mean
i
see
him
surrounded
by
the
ladies
all
the
time
but
maybe
they
all
are
just
friends
just
wanted
to
say
you're
too
fit
and
muscular
for
an
indian
guy
is
it
anxiety
that
i
really
want
to
know
what
to
do
in
life
so
that
i
don't
make
the
wrong
decision
i
just
want
to
know
the
answers
i'm
too
scared
of
messing
up
or
not
being
happy
since
life
is
too
short
wheres
a
good
place
in
college
station
to
work
i
had
a
job
last
semester
waitressing
but
wasn't
making
enough
to
pay
all
my
bills
teenagers
just
don't
tip
like
people
do
in
houston
or
dallas
but
it
also
doesn't
help
the
restaurant
was
dead
where
do
you
guys
work
who's
hiring
i'm
a
guy
who
likes
guys
how
do
i
get
the
attention
of
another
guy
who
likes
guys
that
i
like
i'm
not
a
very
bold
person
and
what
i'm
really
looking
for
is
some
advice
on
just
starting
a
conversation
with
him
why
is
there
so
many
suicidal
posts
if
you
want
to
end
your
life
please
go
seek
help
i
keep
ignoring
your
posts
hang
in
there
it
might
feel
like
hell
but
try
to
smile
it
works
i
am
a
member
of
a
sorority
on
campus
i
am
extremely
involved
love
what
i
do
and
wouldn't
trade
it
for
anything
but
sometimes
it
really
astounds
me
when
people
who
are
apparently
joining
these
organizations
to
become
a
part
of
a
larger
sisterhood
or
brotherhood
put
themselves
in
a
little
bubble
and
only
care
about
themselves
stop
complaining
about
everything
going
wrong
in
your
day
or
bragging
about
your
individual
accomplishments
for
once
and
appreciate
those
around
you
why
can't
everyone
take
a
minute
to
sop
focusing
on
themselves
and
appreciate
others
you
would
be
surprised
how
much
it
means
to
someone
when
you
ask
how
their
day
was
or
even
just
recognize
a
job
well
done
it
doesn't
take
that
much
effort
but
makes
a
world
of
a
difference
seriously
though
does
anyone
know
the
name
of
the
aproned
guy
at
the
market
i
wasn't
kidding
about
the
honorary
degree
someone
make
it
happen
the
frat
vs
bonfire
thing
is
old
shit
can
we
all
just
admit
there
are
douchebags
on
both
sides
fellow
bonfire
guy
hey
guys
i
got
a
gpa
below
2.0
anyone
else
in
this
position
or
been
there
before
what
do
i
do
apart
from
working
harder
i
guess
i'm
trying
to
ask
what
will
happen
not
a
confession
but
a
question
where
is
the
worst
place
to
live
off
campus
i'm
a
junior
and
this
is
my
2nd
year
living
off
campus
so
i
say
gateway
villas
has
to
be
up
there
am
i
the
only
one
who
thinks
cuddling
and
making
out
is
better
than
sex
would
any
girls
be
interested
in
hooking
up
on
a
tuesday
night
2040
i
shed
tears
when
i
poop
i
have
no
clue
why
maybe
out
of
happiness
does
this
happen
to
anyone
else
it
was
another
northgate
night
i
drove
out
with
one
intention
to
test
the
success
of
the
rape
game
so
i
started
dancing
with
a
girl
we
hit
it
off
i
was
feeling
her
and
her
me
things
were
getting
hot
and
heavy
on
the
dance
floor
i
pulled
her
closer
to
me
and
i
whispered
in
he
ear
do
you
want
to
play
the
rape
game
she
responded
no
that's
the
spirit
i
know
it
is
now
let's
go
we
fucked
in
the
parking
lot
i
think
i
may
have
messed
up
the
suspension
but
it
was
well
worth
it
this
chick
was
awesome
i
am
getting
the
ring
next
week
almost
everytime
i
go
to
hoco
i
see
that
really
old
professor
eating
alone
i
always
think
two
things
is
he
asian
or
white
and
i
bet
he
has
a
wicked
interesting
life
f
we're
discussing
the
secret
formula
on
the
third
wednesday
in
january
and
it's
not
raining
outside
after
we've
gargled
with
vanilla
pudding
what
do
we
do
you
know
who's
super
attractive
and
super
cool
and
has
a
lovely
smile
patrick
steveson
that's
who
do
people
look
back
at
their
posts
like
if
you're
gonna
complain
don't
you
want
to
hear
any
of
what
people
have
to
respond
to
you
this
group
is
in
a
way
just
talking
shit
behind
people's
backs
3162
to
the
girl
i
met
yesterday
i
think
her
name
is
samera
i'm
not
a
georgetown
student
but
you
are
seriously
one
of
the
nicest
girls
i've
ever
met
i
wanted
to
dance
with
you
but
you
were
really
good
as
a
girl
who's
super
thin
i
hate
seeing
those
posts
of
runway
models
with
captions
like
this
isn't
sexy
next
to
photos
of
larger
women
thank
you
internet
i
know
i
would
like
to
have
a
body
too
why
does
society
seem
incapable
of
remedying
a
problem
for
a
group
without
putting
another
group
down
6484
can
someone
please
comfort
me
that
my
cornell
degree
will
be
worth
it
and
not
leave
me
homeless
unemployed
after
graduation
i'm
only
a
sophomore
but
i'm
having
debilitating
anxiety
about
job
prospects
a
cornell
degree
does
look
better
right
i
feel
like
i
should
get
my
adderall
dealer
a
christmas
present
for
helping
me
get
good
grades
in
school
i
like
guns
i
enjoy
hunting
and
target
shooting
i'm
not
crazy
i
have
no
desire
to
shoot
anybody
but
would
reluctantly
do
so
in
self
defense
if
necessary
many
of
my
friends
and
family
think
i
am
obsessed
with
them
and
continually
complain
to
me
about
how
i
should
get
rid
of
them
because
they
are
bad
i
want
to
be
nice
in
telling
them
to
fuck
off
but
cant
find
the
right
words
advice
why
do
a
lot
of
black
people
type
like
this
ok
so
ladies
if
an
average
looking
guy
got
the
balls
to
ask
you
to
midnight
yell
without
previously
talking
to
you
would
you
go
with
him
or
would
this
be
completely
awkward
honest
question
here
how
do
girls
feel
about
guys
with
shaved
legs
458
i'm
trying
so
hard
not
to
cry
but
there
i
go
again
as
i
write
this
i
feel
so
helpless
so
inadequate
i
don't
want
to
do
this
anymore
pre
med
is
killing
me
i'm
not
even
sure
i
want
to
be
a
doctor
anymore
i
just
can't
handle
the
stress
no
matter
how
much
i
may
love
the
profession
how
much
i
ever
dreamed
to
become
a
medical
doctor
i
just
don't
seem
to
have
what
it
takes
just
because
you
love
something
it
doesn't
mean
you'll
be
good
at
it
but
how
can
i
quit
now
after
all
the
effort
i
put
in
all
that
money
which
is
not
enough
i
guess
i
feel
so
inadequate
10101
to
the
tall
dark
haired
guy
who
works
in
the
appel
service
center
on
monday
nights
will
you
let
me
handle
your
package
some
time
soon
everyone
plays
an
important
role
in
society
which
is
why
we
joke
about
one
another
but
why
is
it
we
can
say
jokes
about
everyone
but
people
flip
shit
about
when
someone
says
a
black
one
for
example
people
laugh
at
the
joke
of
two
jews
went
to
camp
auschwitz
or
white
guys
and
their
compensating
trucks
perhaps
one
of
the
mexicans
stealing
the
green
cards
from
uno
or
asians
as
bad
drivers
or
how
about
the
arabs
blowing
things
up
and
the
indians
thanking
us
for
coming
again
even
the
natives
get
their
daily
dose
but
we
rarely
hear
a
response
since
whites
killed
most
now
for
the
rustling
of
the
gimmies
part
if
someone
says
or
even
hits
at
something
remotly
close
to
a
stereotype
you're
a
racist
when
it
comes
to
blacks
black
people
like
fried
chicken
racist
the
fuck
i
was
merely
getting
some
stats
for
a
class
i'm
now
a
racist
for
stating
that
a
bussiness
can
thank
a
demographic
for
being
prosperous
if
blacks
did
not
exist
churches
would
be
bankrupt
how
are
all
these
white
girls
gonna
complain
when
guys
look
at
their
ass
but
consistently
wear
leggings
yoga
pants
skin
tight
pants
you
know
damn
well
all
you
want
is
the
attention
so
don't
be
a
stupid
ass
bitch
and
complain
how
guys
only
want
you
for
your
ass
when
you
are
steady
flaunting
it
2061
this
isn't
really
a
confession
but
i'm
just
curious
do
people
even
go
on
dates
at
cornell
or
maybe
a
better
question
do
people
even
go
on
dates
anywhere
anymore
i'm
a
guy
and
i
kinda
want
to
ask
a
girl
out
but
i
don't
want
to
come
across
as
cheesy
11218
every
time
i
here
someone
say
if
you
don't
like
it
here
why
don't
you
just
leave
i
want
to
punch
them
in
the
face
have
any
of
you
ever
considered
the
huge
amount
of
time
and
money
a
transfer
takes
have
you
thought
about
how
you
would
certainly
loose
credits
during
the
process
how
all
this
could
make
you
spend
more
total
time
in
college
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
the
fact
that
some
people
simply
don't
have
the
resources
to
put
their
emotions
first
anyone
remember
how
boring
pooping
was
before
smartphones
girls
what's
your
opinion
on
guys
who
listen
to
lana
del
rey
i'm
a
pregnant
my
boyfriend
doesn't
wanna
keep
the
child
but
i
want
to
should
i
be
proud
as
a
sophomore
girl
for
becoming
pregnant
should
i
keep
the
child
in
which
case
i'd
have
to
ditch
my
bf
and
become
a
single
mother
or
abort
it
also
are
babies
allowed
into
the
classrooms
in
case
i
decide
to
keep
the
baby
7679
i
get
annoyed
when
some
girls
say
on
cornell
confessions
that
it
is
so
hard
to
just
find
a
guy
who
wants
to
chill
and
fuck
for
example
there
was
one
recent
confession
from
a
girl
that
all
she
wants
to
do
is
smoke
weed
chill
and
fuck
and
that
it
shouldnt
be
too
much
to
ask
for
are
you
fucking
kidding
me
just
walk
into
any
frat
house
and
go
at
it
how
is
that
a
valid
problem
3072
to
the
guys
who
always
see
me
as
much
as
i
see
them
around
why
can't
you
just
say
hi
am
i
supposed
to
do
something
about
it
it
just
feels
awkward
7495
the
only
girl
i
have
wanted
to
date
in
my
3.5
years
at
cornell
turns
out
to
be
a
lesbian
not
to
mention
in
a
relationship
really
3065
3060
i
guess
we're
not
allowed
to
use
adjectives
anymore
4632
is
it
shallow
that
i
want
someone
to
make
a
georgetown
confession
about
me
yeah
maybe
but
oh
well
okay
so
i'll
be
a
freshman
about
a
month
from
now
at
texas
a
m
college
station
and
i've
been
with
my
boyfriend
for
almost
a
year
now
his
family
has
become
like
my
second
family
because
my
mom
kicked
me
out
of
the
house
recently
the
thing
is
i
don't
want
to
be
with
him
anymore
because
he's
the
type
that
wants
to
know
every
single
little
thing
i'm
doing
i'm
going
to
be
under
too
much
pressure
to
handle
that
especially
because
i'm
taking
16
hrs
semester
and
i'm
in
a
math
honors
class
plus
i'd
love
to
be
involved
with
all
the
action
like
tradition
and
spirit
stuff
at
a
m
idk
what
to
do
what
do
i
tell
him
also
when
i
get
back
to
my
hometown
i
have
no
where
to
stay
but
with
him
help
3277
voice
vs
hoya
arguments
aside
does
anyone
actually
read
the
independent
how
do
you
tell
your
boyfriend
you
fuck
him
but
yet
you
are
not
enjoining
it
2072
i
hate
the
hotel
school
everyone
is
so
superficial
get
off
your
damn
high
horse
being
rich
doesn't
make
it
okay
to
be
rude
isn't
this
supposed
to
be
a
hospitality
school
what
happened
to
the
hospitable
people
does
anyone
have
rollerblades
and
want
to
be
the
star
in
our
extra
credit
project
it's
a
spaghetti
western
parody
called
digiorno

you
are
seriously
interested

for
real

to
the
guy
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
you
but
someone
came
from
next
door
right
at
12
said
hi
to
me
walked
passed
me
and
stopped
to
turn
around
and
look
back
was
it
you
9018
to
the
dude
who
sat
next
to
me
in
discussion
this
week
and
saw
my
last
name
on
the
sign
in
sheet
i
have
a
friend
crush
on
you
can
we
please
be
friends
this
isn't
a
confession
but
whats
the
best
dorm
on
campus
have
we
really
sunk
this
low
978
guys
we've
been
asking
the
wrong
questions
this
whole
time
what
does
the
h
in
daniel
h
weiss
stand
for
i
feel
depressed
i
constantly
lie
about
my
feelings
and
make
sure
my
attitude
is
always
positive
if
only
because
i
hate
pity
i
can't
tell
anyone
about
my
real
feelings
because
then
i
will
hate
myself
more
not
my
rpls
because
they're
not
the
depressed
type
not
my
roommate
because
we're
so
different
not
my
friends
because
i
don't
have
any
at
least
they
don't
care
for
me
as
much
as
i
used
to
care
for
them
and
they
act
super
fake
and
say
noooo
we
loooove
you
not
my
parents
because
i'm
not
ready
to
come
out
to
them
i'm
crushing
so
bad
on
someone
whom
i
can
never
have
i'm
not
as
smart
as
my
peers
nor
am
i
as
talented
at
anything
as
they
are
why
am
i
at
brown
4112
i
live
in
crown
heights
lived
in
brooklyn
all
my
life
22
don't
remember
it
ever
looking
like
this
outside
that
little
slushie
bullshit
got
a
delayed
opening
but
we
open
like
usual
today
oh
aight
is
it
weird
that
i'm
a
girl
but
sometimes
fantasize
with
getting
with
another
girl
to
the
person
who
literally
has
adhd
oh
you
do
you
and
everyone
else
who
grew
up
overstimulated
by
media
perhaps
you
haven't
considered
that
these
kids
feel
like
they
need
add
medication
because
they
have
undiagnosed
add
if
i
tried
to
get
a
prescription
i
could
in
a
second
but
i
couldn't
afford
it
believe
it
or
not
being
able
to
afford
the
medications
you
need
is
a
privilege
if
you
don't
want
to
give
people
adderall
great
don't
but
you're
not
a
doctor
so
stop
preaching
about
how
you
truly
need
speed
to
function
when
you
don't
know
shit
about
someone
else's
situation
11101
honestly
as
a
guy
with
looks
i
don't
see
it
but
a
crippling
dosage
of
introversion
i
have
no
idea
how
to
flirt
with
girls
outside
of
parties
i
feel
like
girls
tend
to
divert
their
eyes
all
the
time
on
campus
to
those
far
wiser
than
me
what
is
the
most
acceptable
way
to
show
interest
for
instance
if
i
am
passing
you
between
classes
or
see
you
at
a
cafe
what
would
be
the
preferred
way
to
flirt
with
you
14758
i'm
worried
about
living
in
edgemoor
next
year
i
feel
that
i
would
be
excluded
from
the
community
any
thoughts
16543
im
white
and
i
want
a
black
guy
my
roommates
asian
and
she
wants
a
white
guy
i
guess
cornell
is
working
its
magic
with
all
the
people
working
out
at
the
rec
in
the
evening
how
come
it's
always
that
one
international
student
i
can
smell
from
half
way
across
the
gym
stinking
the
place
up
i'm
pretty
sure
curling
15lb
dumb
bells
isn't
that
hard
of
a
workout
bro
4455
i
think
that
nyu's
gender
ratio
needs
to
be
recalculated
how
can
it
be
60
40
female
to
male
if
i'm
the
only
guy
in
a
class
of
30
people
so
i
sometimes
go
to
harry's
with
some
friends
and
they
all
have
dance
partners
what
im
getting
at
is
i
need
a
dance
partner
to
harry's
any
takers
8942
you
make
me
sick
so
why
do
i
want
you
am
i
the
only
one
who
hates
it
when
people
keep
things
from
me
because
they
think
it'll
hurt
my
feelings
don't
try
to
protect
me
tell
me
the
damn
truth
so
i
can
make
informed
decisions
xd
i've
known
that
i've
suffered
from
a
mental
illness
for
all
of
these
years
but
i
never
was
too
sure
of
what
it
could
be
i
went
to
a
psychiatrist
this
week
and
he
told
me
that
it's
borderline
personality
disorder
i've
looked
into
it
and
it
explains
my
life
so
perfectly
almost
to
a
point
where
it's
scary
now
that
i've
been
diagnosed
when
would
be
the
appropriate
time
in
a
relationship
to
tell
someone
i
don't
want
to
scare
people
away
with
them
thinking
that
i'm
some
kind
of
psychopath
but
then
again
it
could
help
them
cope
with
my
different
personality
honestly
if
people
would
shut
the
hell
up
about
racism
it
would
disappear
or
at
least
get
scaled
down
a
whole
lot
more
than
it
already
is
and
to
all
the
minorities
that
say
you
don't
get
equal
treatment
or
opportunity's
you're
full
of
shit
i
guarantee
you
can
get
all
the
same
jobs
i
can
if
you
actually
present
yourself
professionally
and
actually
pursue
something
and
strive
for
it
instead
of
using
the
sorry
excuse
im
a
minority
so
why
try
because
the
white
person
is
going
to
get
it
over
me
also
minorities
get
far
more
scholarship
opportunities
than
a
middle
class
white
male
will
ever
get
i
guarantee
minorities
qualify
for
all
the
scholarships
i
do
but
do
i
qualify
for
all
of
the
ones
they
do
no
so
just
shut
the
hell
up
about
racism
and
all
the
discrimination
you
receive
2593
where
are
the
lady
stoners
of
georgetown
i
know
you're
out
there

back
to
business

hesitating
to
make
a
move
because
i
am
not
sure
if
this
boy
is
straight
he
just
takes
such
a
good
care
of
himself
but
who
is
to
say
that
straight
guys
don't
know
how
to
dress
right

last
month
one
of
my
female
friends
convinced
me
to
buy
a
ticket
for
a
concert
yesterday
so
that
i
would
go
with
her
and
her
friends
i
try
to
contact
her
2
hours
before
the
concert
and
then
she
disappears
no
social
media
her
friends
go
off
the
grid
everything
i
end
up
going
to
the
concert
alone
while
she
posts
pics
of
her
and
her
friends
at
the
concert
on
facebook
why
do
people
have
to
be
so
shitty
so
how
to
parking
tickets
work
on
campus
i
got
a
ticket
but
don't
have
a
parking
permit
and
never
intend
on
getting
one
so
they
can't
link
my
license
plate
number
to
my
student
id
right
so
there's
no
point
in
me
paying
it
right
5387
in
high
school
i
was
so
uptight
and
goody
goody
i
put
homework
before
everything
cringed
at
the
thought
of
ever
drinking
or
smoking
and
my
ipod
consisted
solely
of
christian
rock
now
i
only
feel
the
need
to
do
the
bare
minimum
to
pass
my
classes
love
drinking
and
occasionally
smoking
weed
on
the
weekends
and
enjoy
listening
to
hardcore
rap
and
old
school
hip
hop
when
i
wanna
relax
what's
happening
to
meeeee
17293
are
you
saying
we
shouldn't
judge
people
for
being
racist
that
is
extremely
stupid
there
is
an
obvious
difference
between
criticizing
someone
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin
and
criticizing
them
for
the
choice
to
hate
an
entire
group
of
people
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin
if
you
can't
see
it
i
wonder
how
you
even
got
into
this
school
1688
what's
a
black
guy
have
to
do
to
hook
up
with
a
cute
snow
bunny
wisconsin
will
likely
play
the
loser
of
auburn
missouri
in
their
bowl
game
who
do
you
want
the
badgers
to
play
here's
a
secret
i
have
a
3.8
gpa
no
i'm
not
in
a
joke
major
yes
i
take
a
full
load
of
classes
each
semester
and
yes
you
will
see
me
out
on
weekends
want
to
know
my
secret
i
don't
pull
all
nighters
i
don't
caffeinate
the
shit
out
of
myself
i
don't
study
on
adderall
i
don't
utilize
the
greek
test
bank
i
don't
cheat
on
exams
or
projects
i
just
put
in
good
old
fashioned
time
and
effort
and
apply
myself
because
i
value
my
education
it
upsets
me
that
so
many
people
go
about
their
studies
the
wrong
way
i
hope
i'm
not
the
only
person
who
feels
this
way
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
this
biddie
gonna
sit
in
front
in
class
with
her
cute
ass
thong
showing
but
then
ripping
ones
all
day
sometimes
i
just
become
soo
hungry
that
i
can't
eat
because
im
not
hungry
amiweird
what's
your
stance
on
this
issue
share
it
anonymously
on
the
free

girl
can
i
get
yo
zip
code
what
the

on
every
door
in
the
area
asking
is
big
booty
yolanda

is
it
bad
that
i
turn
myself
on
like
i
will
genuinely
be
in
my
single
doing
homework
glance
in
the
mirror
get
wet
then
easily
make
myself
cum
but
honestly
looking
in
the
mirror
can
get
me
wet
5751
i
understand
what
carly
meant
because
it's
hard
to
look
right
at
you
my
knees
literally
go
weak
my
heart
beats
fast
and
i
ask
myself
wtf
so
in
the
rare
fleeting
moments
i
do
try
and
if
i
seem
confused
it's
the
opposite
i'm
not
confused
at
all
why
are
none
of
the
girls
on
the
soccer
team
humanities
majors
everyone
seems
to
be
some
kind
of
science
or
econ
person
is
this
how
it's
mostly
been
throughout
the
years
wondering
if
it's
a
d1
thing
18862
i
can't
help
but
to
heavily
judge
people
who
sleep
around
all
the
time
what
are
you
missing
from
within
that
you
feel
the
need
to
fulfill
yourself
in
that
way
i
always
wonder
220
i
just
want
a
henle
is
that
too
much
to
ask
for
5962
why
is
georgetown
the
most
boring
place
on
earth
i'm
tired
of
hearing
about
all
the
crazy
parties
my
duke
friends
attend
while
i
stand
around
awkwardly
at
another
lame
house
party
4908
i
was
just
wondering
today
what
do
these
hot
guys
that
i
overhear
these
ugly
to
mediocre
at
best
girls
raving
about
hooking
up
with
actually
look
like
i'm
a
cis
girl
i'm
attracted
to
trans
men
sometimes
i
want
a
penis
sometimes
i
don't
but
i
like
men
and
don't
want
to
be
one
what's
up
with
that
pretty
frustrated
i'm
pretty
sure
i'm
going
to
jail
for
illegal
online
activity
i
looked
up
trans
operations
out
of
curiosity
and
got
a
message
that
says
it
was
actually
not
an
adult
why
aren't
there
safe
sites
to
view
if
you're
curious
about
transitioning
it's
actually
painful
how
awful
tigernet
is
i
just
don't
understand
why
on
a
fucking
college
campus
the
wifi
doesn't
work
properly
i
know
people
have
said
in
the
past
that
it's
a
problem
with
macs
not
the
actual
network
but
can
we
not
improve
the
network
to
support
all
kinds
of
devices
that
is
a
problem
with
the
network
so
basically
eff
u
tigernet
do
all
college
guys
just
want
to
go
for
sexy
girls
i'm
probably
the
furthest
thing
from
sexy
i'll
only
ever
be
cute
would
a
guy
ever
go
for
that

my

especially
during

time
of
the
month.poor
guy
does
that
make
me
an
awful
partner
he
hasn't
complained
yet
but
how
do
you
guys
feel
about
shit
like
this
5819
some
girls
are
seriously
thirsty
and
desperate
to
have
sex
with
just
anyone
i
mean
sex
is
always
the
cherry
on
top
but
do
you
really
have
to
so
dirty
you
are
getting
nowhere
with
that
and
you
are
taking
yourself
off
the
market
to
find
a
nice
guy
in
your
life
you
are
a
woman
give
your
vagina
and
yourself
some
respect
how
on
earth
are
you
supposed
to
approach
girls
at
a
dance
i
have
tried
taps
on
the
shoulder
and
asking
but
i
have
to
yell
and
people
cant
hear
and
it
is
just
weird
i
have
been
told
to
just
go
up
and
start
grinding
but
that
feels
wrong
to
me
is
that
considered
acceptable
is
there
a
polite
way
to
tell
someone
to
f
off
here's
a
confession
that
will
make
a
bunch
of
people
mad
i
have
a
problem
with
black
people
getting
offended
when
people
call
them
black
just
because
you
have
dark
skin
color
doesn't
mean
you're
african
america
that
would
mean
that
either
you
your
parent
s
and
or
grandparent
s
came
directly
from
africa
you
don't
see
black
people
in
england
calling
themselves
african
englishmen
plus
why
is
perfectly
fine
for
all
caucasians
to
be
called
white
whether
they
came
from
england
france
australia
or
even
right
here
in
america
they
are
still
just
considered
to
be
white
i
was
born
in
russia
and
i
will
never
be
asked
to
be
called
a
russian
american
by
blood
i'm
russian
but
by
how
i
live
i'm
an
american
i
don't
need
anyone
giving
me
a
title
that
reminds
me
i'm
american
the
only
group
that
i'm
okay
with
gaining
the
title
american
as
their
race
are
the
native
americans
because
after
all
they
never
left
this
land
for
those
who
call
me
a
racist
the
first
best
friends
i
had
were
black
and
i
think
racist
people
are
some
of
the
stupidest
people
on
earth
demanding
to
be
referred
as
an
african
american
is
using
the
race
card
and
i
have
little
respect
for
people
who
try
to
use
race
to
prove
their
point
whites
are
not
superior
because
they
are
white
nor
should
blacks
get
special
treatment
because
they
are
black
whether
you're
black
white
green
or
purple
you
are
human
and
you
gain
my
full
respect
for
the
fact
that
you're
human
right
now
i
live
in
america
and
know
i'm
an
american
you
can
call
me
what
ever
you
want
but
it
doesn't
change
who
i
am
i
live
by
a
set
of
principles
that
i
always
follow
and
in
the
end
everyone
is
equal
in
the
eyes
of
god
that
goes
for
my
god
and
the
other
gods
because
i'm
sure
none
of
them
are
racist
that's
my
confession
if
you
call
it
a
confession
just
sayin
who
the
hell
keeps
voting
cary
cheshire
back
into
office
coauthor
of
the
lgbt
religious
bill
hating
on
graduate
students
attempting
to
get
the
sbp
kicked
out
of
office
be
more
attentive
about
who
you
vote
to
represent
the
students
ags
let's
elect
people
who
represent
our
true
values

can
all
of
the
minorities
stop
saying
that
they
hate
people

their
stereotype

hate
white
tinos
and

queer
community
touting
the
term
straight
acting
you
go
to
cornell
an
ivy
league
university

should
be
smart
enough
to
not
expect
people
to
act
like
stereotypes
and
smart
enough
to
not
be
angry
at
them
for
not
being
a
predictable
clich

once
and
while
when

girlfriend

courageous
conversations
confessions
of
discrimination
discussion
happening
on
december
3rd
5
00
in
bemis
i'm
excited
to
be
a
troll
so
look
out
for
me
to
the
corps
girl
that
got
on
bonfire
at
1
22ish
today
oct
21
at
weiner
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
you
are
extremely
beautiful
i
wish
i
made
an
attempt
to
talk
to
you
but
i
couldn't
figure
out
what
to
say
to
you
all
i
know
about
you
was
your
tag
said
salinas
and
you
were
wearing
a
white
belt
i'm
not
sure
how
the
ranking
system
works
in
the
corps
but
does
that
mean
you
are
a
fish
i
wish
you
could
of
looked
up
from
your
phone
at
least
once
and
shoot
me
a
smile
that
would
of
just
made
my
day
even
greater
but
at
least
seeing
your
beautiful
face
brought
me
great
joy
if
i
ever
see
you
again
i
hope
i
have
the
courage
to
talk
to
you
does
anyone
have
advice
for
talking
possibly
asking
out
a
corps
girl
11407
i'm
sitting
across
from
a
guy
in
the
library
who
is
loudly
and
obnoxiously
chomping
on
gum
like
a
cow
and
is
blasting
his
music
in
his
headphones
seriously
dude
stop
that
shit
what
does
it
mean
when
one
is
thirsty
i've
been
told
that
since
i
work
at
jamba
juice
my
attractiveness
rating
went
up
is
this
true
997
involving
myself
in
a
relationship
was
the
worst
thing
i
could
have
done
while
attending
this
school
my
first
year
in
ucsb
i
went
out
with
this
girl
and
i
thought
she
was
the
only
thing
that
existed
in
the
world
i
didn't
form
meaningful
relationships
with
my
dorm
mates
and
basically
only
associated
myself
with
my
special
someone
i
truly
gave
my
life
for
this
girl
but
after
some
time
we
broke
up
what
can
you
expect
from
iv
right
i
found
myself
with
no
real
people
to
hang
out
with
no
one
to
live
with
for
the
next
couple
of
years
and
i
was
alone
the
saddest
thing
is
that
i
haven't
even
told
anybody
the
story
i
am
writing
to
this
page
that's
how
alone
i
am
it
really
sucks
i'm
not
saying
that
you
shouldn't
date
in
iv
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
don't
forget
that
there
is
a
world
out
there
other
than
your
significant
other
friendships
last
a
lot
longer
than
relationships
with
a
special
someone
is
what
i
really
wish
someone
could
have
told
me
a
long
time
ago
so
i
am
assuming
all
these
country
boys
really
want
is
a
dolled
up
pretty
girl
why
not
a
girl
who
isn't
afraid
to
wear
her
work
boots
to
school
why
not
a
girl
who
is
not
afraid
to
get
dirty
and
does
so
daily
why
not
a
girl
who
not
only
can
drive
a
truck
but
also
back
it
into
any
spot
with
precision
i
am
a
down
home
country
girl
looking
for
a
cowboy
to
sweep
me
off
my
feet
darnit
2528
it
is
5
00
i've
just
woken
up
from
what
seems
like
a
week
long
sleep
my
head
is
killing
me
you
won't
believe
what
i
discovered
last
night
you
simply
won't
i
donned
my
suit
in
true
violet
avenger
fashion
and
scaled
to
the
top
floor
of
bobst
it
was
a
quiet
night
despite
it
being
so
late
i
had
brought
a
book
with
me
it
seemed
like
a
great
night
to
catch
up
on
some
reading
for
class
the
night
was
long
but
it
was
warm
so
few
people
look
up
in
new
york
you
know
i
could
stand
on
top
of
bobst
for
years
probably
and
no
one
would
ever
notice
i
decided
to
go
back
into
bobst
around
1
in
the
morning
things
were
calm
the
university
didn't
need
me
the
top
floor
of
bobst
for
those
of
you
who
don't
know
it's
john
sexton's
office
as
i
went
to
change
in
the
bathroom
and
go
back
home
i
saw
a
light
flicker
near
sexton's
office
i
approached
the
office
and
heard
john
sexton
approach
the
door
i
hid
immediately
he
left
my
curiosity
overtook
me
i
picked
open
the
lock
i
saw
on
his
desk
a
manila
folder
i
opened
it
on
top
of
the
document
the
2013
plan
i
thought
it
was
the
2031
plan
i
said
to
myself
i
kept
reading
i
couldn't
believe
what
i
read
the
2013
plan
the
2013
plan
there
are
only
a
few
months
left
my
head
is
killing
me
as
i
write
this
i
can't
remember
what
i
read
on
those
documents
only
that
it
would
change
everything
i
remember
one
more
thing
as
i
left
the
office
i
saw
the
elevator
john
was
on
descending
far
below
the
basement
the
sign
above
the
elevator
read
hopefully
tomorrow
i'll
remember
more
what
happened
last
night
was
it
even
mr
sexton
that
i
saw
6253
why
am
i
never
good
enough
to
go
to
your
formals
or
date
nights
but
you'll
call
me
right
after
for
a
quick
fuck
never
again
hey
admin
ares
admin
chronos
i'm
not
here
to
say
how
hot
i
think
y'all
are
or
that
y'all
post
shitty
confessions
or
anything
but
just
wondering
what's
y'alls
major
16107
i
got
an
email
a
day
ago
from
the
ja
saying
that
i'll
now
have
a
case
being
considered
because
i
am
being
accused
of
something
that
there
are
no
witnesses
to
except
the
person
accusing
me
of
doing
it
i
was
wondering
if
for
the
ja
to
say
i'm
guilty
do
they
have
to
prove
that
i
did
it
and
have
witnesses
to
see
that
i
did
something
because
i
didn't
do
it
and
there
was
nobody
there
to
witness
it
any
thoughts
anyone
or

spent
time
in
a
library

of
my
good

worried

am
forced
to
go
do
things

with
my
school
on
graduation
day

am
going
to
be
forced

months
later

have
no
idea
on
what
i
am
spending
60k
a
year

i
going
to
make
it
worth
it
i
am
in

with
a
guy

thousands
of

might
not
even
be
on
the
same
page
with
me
i
have
no
idea
what
i
am
doing
with
my
life
and
i
am
letting
the
most
important
person
in
my
life
who
has
been
with
me
through
everything
down
i
am
so
scared
i
feel
i
can't
breathe
most
of
the
times
how
did
i
get
here
i
know
these
confessions
all
sound
the
same
but
all
i
want
in
life
is
10
supermodel
wives
and
a
mansion
made
out
of
solid
gold
is
that
too
much
to
ask
for
what
is
your
favorite
kitchen
appliance
to
incorporate
into
your
love

at
your
roomie

is
one
of
the
sweetest

parting
gift
of
your
own
piss
in
a
water
bottle
about
being
ashamed
to
graduate
with
us
we're
all
equally
as
stunned
we
had
quite
the
little
laugh
over
your
confession
especially
over
your
limited
grasp
of
the
english
language
bitch
you
call
yourself
a
swan
but
your
ass
is
nothing
more
than
a
toad
and
watch
out

she'll
give
ya
warts
too
we
may
not
win
the
superlative
for
greatest

poked
fun
at
one
of
my
mannerisms

while

make
me

self
conscious

with
some
friends
altogether

do
i
ask
them
to

duncan
hall
i
am
sleepwalking
and
next
thing
i
know
the
hallway
roars
with
ned
t
s
hind
belch
dude
just
keeps
walking
swinging
his
coat
tails
and
wafting
all
the
smoke
in
the
air
my
only
question
is
what
the
f
k
do
you
eat
16397
im
a
christian
athlete
looking
for
a
christian
girlfriend
and
i'm
having
a
hard
time
accepting
god's
timing
is
it
bad
that
i
want
a
solid
relationship
right
now
13340
i'm
terrified
of
cicadas
and
i'm
staying
in
ithaca
this
summer
how
bad
are
they
the
worst
mistake
i
ever
made
was
graduating
can
i
go
back
to
college
now
how
does
bonfire
work
do
i
have
to
join
if
i
want
to
go
to
one
or
can
i
just
show
up
to
a
bonfire
event
i'm
a
girl
and
i
don't
understand
why
so
many
girls
are
so
irrational
controlling
and
why
so
many
guys
put
up
with
it
it
gives
us
a
bad
name
like
seriously
why
can't
so
many
girls
let
guys
have
their
independence
it's
not
like
you
have
to
be
all
up
on
each
other
24
7
i
love
having
a
boyfriend
when
i
do
have
one
but
i
like
having
my
space
too
if
a
guy
wants
to
play
video
games
let
him
do
it
if
he
wants
to
have
a
guys
night
with
his
friends
let
him
as
long
as
he
isn't
doing
it
all
the
time
it's
fine
let
him
be
happy
life
is
all
about
balance
and
then
guys
why
do
you
put
with
with
the
shit
those
kinds
of
girls
give
you
you
know
when
they
won't
let
you
talk
to
any
girls
at
all
and
you
have
to
constantly
tell
them
what
you're
doing
if
it's
for
pussy
then
i
have
no
respect
for
you
for
the
sheer
fact
that
you
would
put
up
with
so
much
stress
and
bullshit
just
because
you
can't
keep
it
in
your
pants
how
do
you
find
out
someone's
worner
box
for
secret
santa
i'm
really
tired
of
seeing
ask
these
people
posting
about
how
they
can't
make
friends
seriously
i
had
literally
no
friends
until
i
came
to
college
clearly
you
aren't
looking
to
make
any
or
you're
to
busy
pointing
out
the
flaws
that
everyone
possess
it's
not
hard
to
make
friends
here
you
just
need
to
get
it
of
your
little
safety
bubble
and
meet
people
so
is
iqp
like
vegas
what
happens
on
iqp
stays
on
iqp
5059
since
when
did
half
of
the
georgetown
football
team
start
going
to
down
dog
yoga
14952
ok
so
i'm
guilty
of
having
heavily
padded
up
my
cv
to
get
into
cornell
the
senator
i
worked
wth
for
a
month
he's
my
dad's
best
friend
just
went
to
his
office
for
an
hour
or
two
max
and
my
volunteering
in
asia
well
it
was
made
up
i
went
there
on
a
holiday
instead
there's
a
reason
why
college
admissions
suck
terribly
in
this
country
having
just
graduated
top
of
my
class
and
getting
great
scores
on
tests
isn't
enough
there's
a
reason
why
minorities
and
the
poor
have
it
tough
getting
into
the
ivies
all
the
extra
intangible
crap
that
you
have
to
do
to
show
that
you're
better
than
the
rest
is
just
really
really
frustrating
especially
if
you
re
sure
you
want
to
go
into
stem
fields
sorry
to
all
the
rest
who
think
all
this
matters
i
guess
i'm
just
being
honest
here
i
legitimately
want
to
murder
people
who
walk
into
a
dead
quiet
space
in
the
library
and
start
talking
are
you
kidding
me
foreign
people
are
even
worse
it's
like
they
don't
realize
their
talking
is
annoying
regardless
of
what
language
they're
speaking
just
shut
the
fuck
up
in
the
library
everyone
since
there
is
controversy
over
the
names
of
teams
in
sports
can
i
suggest
we
change
the
name
of
houston
texans
they
represent
entitlements
at
their
worst
by
giving
the
other
team
touchdowns
i
am
offended
to
have
my
texas
heritage
represented
by
a
sorry
ass
team
2247
every
time
i
see
the
bon's
menus
my
urge
to
break
something
rises
who
the
hell
thought
that
the
wall
of
text
run
on
sentence
no
capital
letters
approach
is
useful
in
any
way
if
it's
easier
for
me
to
walk
around
the
bon
and
visually
examine
each
station
than
it
is
to
read
your
menus
you
are
doing
it
wrong
this
has
got
to
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
fix
too
bullet
points
motherfucker
do
you
speak
it
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
i
have
horrible
headaches
almost
everyday
all
day
i
don't
want
to
take
big
scary
pills
because
of
personal
beliefs
i
researched
the
medical
use
of
marijuana
and
there
are
only
very
poor
quality
research
done
on
the
subject
what's
the
deal
with
this
shit
i
just
want
relief
from
headaches
in
a
more
natural
way
than
pills
i
just
don't
get
what
our
federal
government
has
against
marijuana
1043
as
a
guy
am
i
supposed
to
awkwardly
text
or
message
girls
living
in
a
place
with
all
girls
makes
me
wonder
orgy
11078
i'm
a
girl
and
i've
always
considered
myself
straight
but
sometimes
when
i
see
a
beautiful
girl
i
really
want
to
cuddle
with
her
hold
her
and
be
romantic
with
her
i
just
want
to
cuddle
with
her
but
i
don't
have
any
sort
of
desire
to
see
her
without
clothes
or
to
do
sexual
things
with
her
does
anyone
else
ever
feel
this
way
i
am
95
positive
my
parents
are
cheating
on
each
other
and
it
is
driving
me
insane
does
true
marriage
even
exist
anymore
16084
i
appreciate
the
people
who
play
the
music
from
the
clock
tower
but
do
they
really
have
to
play
a
concert
at
7
30
am
many
people
are
still
trying
to
sleep
at
that
point
including
myself
and
it
wakes
me
up
every
morning
as
a
prospective
student
i
really
need
to
know
truthfully
how
is
the
social
scene
here
i
keep
hearing
so
many
negative
stereotypes
about
it
that
even
though
i
know
nu
is
a
place
that
academically
is
everything
i
was
looking
for
i'm
now
really
worried
about
committing
to
nu
for
the
bad
social
scene
and
am
considering
my
state's
public
school
instead
which
i
know
has
a
great
social
scene
why
won't
you
tell
us
what
happened
to
admin
loki
who
all
is
taking
the
tropical
forest
and
coral
reef
ecology
course
in
belize
next
year
the
chick
at
subway
has
a
thing
for
me
but
she's
not
really
my
type
i
love
subway
so
i
try
to
go
when
i
don't
think
she's
working
because
i
know
i
come
across
borderline
flirting
when
i'm
just
being
friendly
and
she
always
wants
to
chat
while
she's
making
me
a
sandwich
which
is
hilarious
can't
we
just
stand
there
awkwardly
like
everybody
else
lol
and
the
admin
is
admin
edit
admin

is
clark
kent
and
admin
2
is

wayne
happy
now
admin

i'm
jealous
of
my
friends
that
have
low
standards
seriously
how
awesome
would
it
be
to
find
women
you
find
attractive
even
if
they
aren't
and
be
able
to
pull
them
every
night
5778
after
rangila
i
realized
i
have
brown
fever
sharang
are
you
into
the
swirl
because
i
want
you
in
me
where
are
the
tall
intelligent
respectable
guys
the
ones
who
aren't
immature
and
can
handle
an
independent
lady
smart
enough
to
not
need
a
man
3938
sometimes
i
feel
anti
social
for
not
leaving
my
room
and
watching
hulu
all
night
but
then
i
think
would
i
rather
watch
jon
stewart
make
fun
of
fox
news
or
hear
people
whine
about
their
prelim
schedules
2083
what
the
fuck
are
they
putting
in
the
food
here
i
literally
farted
while
writing
this
confession
blameitonthebon
i
fucked
my
next
door
neighbor
now
what
want
to
be
more
sexually
active
but
i
have
never
made
out
with
someone
before
i
am
confident
that
i
can
do
everything
else
but
it's
the
making
out
part
that
seems
a
bit
tricky
any
advice
really
i
just
want
a
girl
who
doesn't
feel
like
she
needs
me
but
just
wants
me
being
needed
is
a
lot
of
responsibility
and
i
know
relationships
are
about
responsibility
but
that's
a
lot
of
it
put
onto
one
side
of
the
scale
isn't
it
better
to
be
just
wanted
for
yourself
rather
than
being
needed
as
an
emotional
crutch
it's
almost
like
being
used
by
someone
except
it's
unintentional
and
a
result
of
kindness
i
get
so
annoyed
whenever
i
see
posts
by
freshmen
about
how
sad
they
are
to
go
home
for
a
whole
3
months
and
how
much
they
are
going
to
miss
everyone
and
this
school
try
being
a
senior
and
getting
ready
to
say
goodbye
to
this
wonderful
campus
and
all
of
the
people
you
have
come
to
know
and
love
over
the
last
four
years
from
your
best
friends
to
that
random
person
you
always
drunkenly
bond
with
but
you
aren't
even
really
sure
if
you
have
the
right
name
is
it
tim
or
tom
you'll
never
know
for
sure
stop
being
sad
and
be
grateful
that
you
have
more
time
left
at
unh
because
in
a
few
years
you
will
be
sitting
here
like
me
just
wishing
you
could
do
it
all
over
again
as
much
as
i
am
ready
to
be
done
with
classes
and
homework
and
exams
i
can't
help
but
look
back
on
all
of
the
wonderful
memories
unh
has
given
me
and
wish
that
it
wasn't
time
to
say
goodbye
however
all
good
things
must
come
to
an
end
right
so
to
all
of
the
seniors
good
luck
with
everything
you
do
from
here
on
out
let's
take
this
so
called
real
world
by
storm
and
to
all
the
freshmen
out
there
i
know
you're
gonna
miss
your
friends
all
summer
but
you
have
no
idea
how
much
better
it
gets
from
here
enjoy
it
16417
i
ended
one
friendship
two
weekends
ago
he
may
not
know
or
care
i'm
about
to
do
the
same
with
you
this
past
year
has
been
hard
but
i
have
reaffirmed
my
worth
and
self
respect
i'm
better
and
stronger
than
you
know
in
before
but
are
you
harder
faster
cornell
and
the
world
are
so
much
bigger
and
significant
than
the
people
who
can't
be
bothered
to
care
to
all
the
people
who
periodically
post
about
depression
loneliness
and
f
cked
up
friends
don't
forget
how
awesome
you
are
you
really
are
and
when
you
stop
catastrophizing
and
chastising
yourself
long
enough
you'll
see
that
again
found
out
i
got
cheated
on
by
my
boyfriend
the
night
before
i
went
to
visit
him
this
past
weekend
why
are
people
so
shitty
i
get
really
annoyed
when
hot
people
talk
about
their
problems
while
i
know
that
everyone
has
their
own
struggles
or
problems
in
life
seeing
someone
that
has
a
six
pack
or
could
be
a
model
complain
about
not
being
able
to
find
a
meaningful
relationship
or
something
just
makes
me
so
angry
i
think
like
fuck
you
are
you
seriously
bitching
about
that
the
first
day
of
classes
after
lunch
time
in
the
afternoon
i'll
go
to
the
office
where
we
so
often
run
into
one
another
then
you
can
finally
make
a
move
so
we
don't
waste
anymore
time
deal
twit
you
made
my
weekend
thank
you
for
taking
a
sad
time
and
finding
hilarity
creativity
spontaneity
and
energy
to
share
perhaps
we
should
have
a
permanently
ongoing
show
no
one
would
ever
feel
lonely
again
2280
girls
like
a
guy
who
have
got
the
balls
to
actually
go
up
to
them
and
ask
them
out
now
repeat
after
me
hi
would
you
like
to
get
coffee
with
me
sometime
you
may
add
complements
where
you
see
fit
that
concludes
this
confession
i
am
a
female
about
5'10
and
i
just
want
have
my
mind
blown
but
cannot
find
anyone
willing
to
participate
in
all
honesty
i
am
a
4
i
am
even
to
the
point
where
i
would
where
a
paper
bag
any
takers
i'm
looking
to
start
going
to
a
church
next
semester
i
don't
have
many
friends
so
i
don't
know
of
any
good
ones
can
people
please
recommend
churches
5013
does
anyone
know
if
that
blonde
claire
chick
in
harbin
is
single
what
makes
girls
like
a
guy
ive
always
wondered
if
theres
like
a
mini
check
list
that
runs
through
a
girls
head
11347
where
can
i
find
nice
clean
cut
guys
to
hook
up
with
i
find
people
so
pretentious
when
they
post
a
picture
of
a
high
b
and
say
oh
no
my
streak
of
as
is
gone
does
the
world
really
have
to
give
a
two
cents
about
your
grades
now
it
would
be
different
if
you
posted
i
cured
cancer
then
you
can
receive
all
the
praise
you
desire
but
until
then
bye
bye
why
are
superheroes
always
white
why
can't
they
be
black
white
hispanic
asian
and
maybe
even
have
different
sexual
orientation
in
there
too
457
so
i'm
always
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
when
i'm
walking
below
you
girls
in
those
short
dresses
on
a
flight
of
stairs
whether
that
be
stare
at
my
shoes
read
a
text
i've
already
read
or
pretend
to
be
changing
songs
on
my
ipod
but
this
week
i
left
my
phone
and
ipod
in
my
room
and
didn't
particularly
feel
like
looking
at
my
shoes
so
yeah
i
took
a
look
do
i
feel
like
a
terrible
person
yeah
would
i
do
it
again
it's
gonna
take
some
real
strength
not
to
lord
please
help
i'm
not
a
religious
guy
but
i
find
it
quite
stupid
when
a
dumb
sluts
put
up
pictures
statuses
tweets
of
them
quoting
the
bible
and
saying
god
is
good
when
in
reality
they've
done
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
bible
says
i
don't
know
maybe
it's
just
me
3893

this
country
behind
japanese
mexican
immigrants
native
americans
arabs
and
blacks
i
seriously
can't
believe
it
when
you
guys
bitch
and
moan
about
how
it's
so
hard
to
be
white
and
how
those
minorities
get
all
the
benefits
take
that
fleeting
feeling
of
being
ostracized
and
cry
about
it
bitch
you
just
experienced
a
small
slice
of
my
life
sucks
right
i'm
a
44f

that
intimidating
or
super
unappealing
to
guys
someone

the
police
trucks
that
load
up
all
the
drunken
people
remind
me
of
something
out
of
a
horror
movie
where
do
they
take
them
it's
like
a
transport
system
to
an
inevitable
death
in
a
gas
chamber
how
do
girls
get
over
their
fear
of
losing
their
virginity
helppppp

your
secret

on
the
free

really
want
to
learn
how
to
play
acoustic
guitar
and
am
curious
if
there
are
any
classes
here
to
learn
am
i
the
only
one
who
is
getting
extremely
pissed
off
at
the
java
plug
in
one
minute
it
works
and
the
next
it
suddenly
stops
oh
and
lets
not
forget
the
constant
prompting
no
java
i
don't
think
i
want
to
run
you
i
just
decided
to
open
my
computer
and
stare
at
the
owl

a
little
while
thanks

i'm
about
to
graduate
and
after
being
rejected
from
all
the
grad
schools
i
applied
to
and
having
little
to
no
job
opportunities
with
a
degree
in
my
major
i'm
scared
to
death
but
would
i
have
chosen
to
study
anything
else
not
a
damn
chance
in
hell

i
just
have
a
few
questions
to
the
multiple
black
students
standing
outside
my
door
last
night
around
1
00am
listening
to
me
and
my
girlfriend
are
you
in
high
school
where
you
giggle
and
blush
at
the
discussion
of
anything
passed
your
mental
capacity
or
were
you
just
raised
to
be
annoying
we
were
keeping
it
quiet
and
you
all
were
annoying
as
fuck
outside
the
door
i
guarantee
you
that
no
one
will
think
it's
funny
if
you
tell
them
i
listened
to
a
couple
last
night
outside
their
door
have
sex
now
you
all
can
keep
your
head
down
when
i
pass
through
the
common
room
like
you've
been
doing
fuck
her
on
the
floor
before
we
make
it
to
the
bed
that's
what
your
ass
really
call
started
from
the
bottom
my
girlfriend
likes
to
troll
craigslist
tinder
etc
for
other
girls
who
are
looking
for
a
friend
and
sparks
up
a
conversation
with
them
she
finds
out
first
if
they're
single
then
if
they
are
she
continues
to
get
to
know
them
telling
them
lies
about
how
she's
single
but
still
has
feelings
for
her
ex
aka
me
the
still
current
girlfriend
and
so
much
more
she
even
tried
setting
up
a
rendezvous
with
one
of
them
from
craigslist
during
a
weekend
she
was
suppose
to
be
in
san
antonio
for
drill
and
i
don't
know
if
i
can
even
trust
the
fact
that
she
says
the
girl
never
responded
i
know
i'm
an
idiot
for
even
continuing
this
relationship
7yrs
in
feb
but
how
can
i
start
over
learning
to
trust
someone
all
over
again
the
kicker
i
am
the
one
who
found
out
according
to
my
girl
that
she
tried
getting
pregnant
via
turkey
baster
from
one
of
her
friends
i
am
the
one
that
caught
her
cheating
on
me
with
a
girl
she
met
on
xbox
i
am
the
one
who
then
read
the
email
that
actually
told
me
the
whole
story
thanks
to
said
girl
i
am
also
the
one
who
found
the
multiple
conversations
from
the
random
people
from
craigslist
and
tinder
and
the
most
recent
one
sided
conversations
from
my
girl
to
said
girl
telling
her
how
she
missed
talking
to
her
according
to
my
girlfriend
the
girl
wrote
another
nasty
email
telling
my
girl
how
much
she
ruined
her
life
and
how
she
can't
hang
on
to
any
kind
of
relationship
so
she
was
just
responding
to
the
email
and
that
what
she
said
to
the
girl
again
didn't
mean
anything
yes
i
know
that
explanation
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
either
it's
all
sad
but
disgusting
at
the
same
time
even
more
disgusting
that
i'm
still
here
i
know
she
is
going
to
eventually
read
this
because
technology
is
her
kryptinite
thanks
to
its
animosity
and
secretiveness
and
the
fact
i
have
no
earthly
idea
refer
above
that
she
was
doing
any
of
this
so
i
love
you
honey
but
you're
a
real
piece
of
work
even
for
a
crazy
bitch
like
me
i
want
to
go
to
hullabalooza
music
festival
but
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
passion
pit
will
be
there
since
it
keeps
talking
game
about
it
being
a
dj
set
and
i
don't
know
what
that
means
what's
a
brother
to
do
2544
honestly
i'm
so
screwed
for
principles
of
biology
1
it's
like
actually
so
embarrassing
can
someone
tell
me
how
they
studied
for
it
i'm
gonna
cry
i
might
break
down
for
like
the
50th
time
admin
chronos
sent
me
the
fucking
creepiest
snapchats
tonight
started
out
at
riverside
campus
ended
at
layne's
drive
through
and
in
between
were
a
lot
of
country
roads
in
bryan
while
he
was
listening
to
the
knife
the
fuck
were
you
doing
man
what
do
insert

i
hate
this
whole
abortion
debate
people
who
are
against
abortions
don't
get
abortions
people
who
want
them
get
it
either
way
someone
else
having
an
abortion
isn't
going
to
affect
your
life
in
any
significant
manner
so
stop
telling
other
people
what
to
do
and
mind
your
own
business
i
swear
globalization
and
social
media
has
given
people
the
false
impression
that
some
people
can
decide
how
other
people
should
live
their
lives
just
mind
your
own
fucking
business
can't
we
all
just
be
happy
with
that
you
can
have
your
abortion
and
i
don't
need
to
know
about
it
problem
solved
and
everybody
is
happy
let's
move
on
in
the
world
whats
your
nice
weather
chill
outside
tune
there
are
times
when
i'd
be
sitting
in
class
and
all
of
a
sudden
my
eyes
would
go
tunnel
vision
and
it'd
feel
like
the
walls
are
collapsing
in
on
me
and
that
there's
not
enough
air
in
the
room
and
all
my
pores
are
opening
up
and
sweating
everywhere
i'd
have
to
bolt
out
of
the
room
and
find
a
quiet
corner
outside
and
hug
myself
for
maybe
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
to
make
them
go
away
i
tried
telling
one
of
my
friends
about
this
i
thought
she'd
understand
she
had
been
through
hell
and
we
had
been
close
for
years
instead
she
called
me
a
straight
white
male
who
lives
in
the
suburbs
and
has
never
worked
a
day
in
his
life
what
right
do
i
have
to
be
feeling
these
feelings
when
there
are
so
many
worse
things
happening
in
the
world
does
my
privilege
mean
that
i
suddenly
can't
have
anxiety
that
somehow
i'm
not
allowed
to
address
my
screwed
up
hormones
as
things
that
are
real
and
that
terrorize
me
every
day
i
know
somebody
here
is
gonna
tell
me
to
go
to
counseling
or
peer
counselors
but
what
the
fuck
is
the
point
if
my
closest
friends
think
i'm
somehow
faking
or
exaggerating
my
symptoms
because
i
have
no
reason
to
be
feeling
them
in
the
first
place
can
anyone
tell
me
how
to
get
involved
in
the
fashion
show
not
as
a
designer
but
as
a
model
carnivore
club
quick
question
ags
does
anybody
knows
if
a
m
offers
music
classes
kinda
like
kine
199
i
wanted
to
learn
how
to
play
guitar
and
taking
a
class
would
be
perfect
because
the
cost
would
go
directly
to
my
tuition
thanks
for
the
help
i'm
slowly
beginning
to
think
my
roommate
is
turning
into
a
zombie
i
if
i
strike
his
head
with
a
blunt
object
will
i
be
arrested
or
praised
as
a
hero
for
preventing
the
zombie
apocalypse
i
love
my
boyfriend
but
because
of
circumstances
i
can't
say
because
if
i
did
a
lot
of
you
would
know
who
i
am
i
haven't
seen
him
all
winter
break
i
won't
be
seeing
him
until
we
return
to
college
station
actually
anyway
my
ex
lives
in
my
hometown
and
we
plan
on
seeing
each
other
just
to
kinda
clear
the
air
since
we
ended
in
bad
terms
and
later
he
confessed
he
still
had
feelings
for
me
i
feel
like
my
heart
is
heavy
when
i
think
of
seeing
him
too
so
how
should
i
act
when
i
see
him
i
think
we'll
be
doing
dinner
at
a
restaurant
we
both
used
to
like
very
much
when
we
were
together
i
know
for
a
fact
i
don't
want
to
kiss
him
hug
him
do
anything
that
will
make
him
think
i
don't
want
to
be
with
my
boyfriend
which
i
do
i
just
also
want
to
be
with
him
but
i
know
that's
wrong
i
know
this
is
confusing
i'm
fucked
aren't
i
my
question
is
for
those
who
live
off
campus
now
is
it
worth
it
to
get
a
parking
permit
next
semester
if
i'm
probably
going
to
be
driving
to
campus
every
morning
since
i
usually
sleep
until
very
close
to
when
my
classes
start
if
so
where
is
the
best
value
lot
to
park
because
i
live
on
campus
and
park
i'm
southside
garage
now
the
400
i'm
paying
now
is
a
bit
much
question
why
do
birds
fly
upside
down
over
austin
answer
cause
there
ain't
anything
worth
shitting
on
luckingfonghorns
thatsexactlywhatweregonnadotoemags
sawemoff
rivalriesneverdie
to
the
person
who
said
they
value
women
no
you
only
value
your
idea
of
what
you
think
a
woman
should
be
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
about
getting
married
god
designed
women
to
get
married
and
raise
a
family
to
get
to
heaven
that's
huge
job
that
is
the
ultimate
job
god
made
for
women
it's
also
a
humble
job
because
women
are
to
serve
their
families
like
jesus
also
jesus
says
the
servant
is
the
greatest
among
men
god
himself
designed
a
perfect
plan
how
then
can
we
tell
him
it's
not
good
enough
let's
take
a
minute
to
rest
from
our
constant
bickering
of
political
parties
ignore
my
grammar
and
spelling
since
submitting
this
on
a
phone
was
not
the
easiest
with
that
said
gather
around
ags
i
have
a
story
to
tell
i
remember
when
i
was
in
middle
school
they
were
interviewing
iraqis
on
the
civil
war
or
the
first
elections
i
cannot
remember
and
where
they
the
iraqis
where
they
stood
on
the
conflict
the
american
reporter
asked
whether
he
was
a
sunni
or
shi'ite
sorry
if
i
misspelled
it
the
gentleman
responded
i'm
an
iraqi
looking
back
to
this
now
it
brought
a
chill
down
my
spine
this
guy
understood
what
democracy
was
about
sure
they
argued
but
whether
they
know
it
or
not
the
only
thing
they
can
rely
on
is
each
other
we
can
learn
from
those
who
we
have
taught
so
we
can
realize
how
far
we've
strayed
we
are
all
americans
why
can
we
not
start
acting
like
it
7741
no
one
believes
me
when
i
tell
them
i'm
actually
really
shy
with
social
anxiety
how
hard
is
it
to
believe
that
a
girl
who
seems
to
have
everything
going
for
her
looks
brains
friends
could
actually
be
dying
inside
under
the
stress
and
the
pressure
to
try
and
keep
up
the
act
i
think
college
is
turning
me
into
an
alcoholic
because
drinking
is
now
the
only
way
i
can
go
to
my
mixers
and
feel
somewhat
comfortable
and
all
the
stress
is
just
making
my
eating
disorder
come
back
the
worst
part
is
i'm
so
good
at
lying
and
pretending
that
i
can't
even
go
talk
to
someone
about
it
because
i
know
all
the
right
answers
to
make
them
think
nothing
is
wrong
with
me
summer
can't
come
soon
enough
i've
always
wanted
to
taste
falcon
punch
does
it
taste
like
fruit
punch

i
don't
know
what
the
fishbowl
is
what
is
it
is
this
cc
confessions
or

l.o.l
why
the

put
on

floor
of
my

with
no

why

a
while
ago
i
yelled
at
a
bunch
of
girls
for
being
very
loud
on
a
late
school
night
i
apologized
after
doing
so
but
since
then
some
of
the
girls
have
been
acting
very
friendly
towards
me
i
know
they
are
not
acting
this
way
because
they
are
being
friendly
but
i
think
it's
more
of
sort
of
a
passive
aggressive
behavior
to
see
what
i'm
all
about
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
has
happened
where
someone
whom
i
have
wronged
has
started
being
friendly
towards
me
and
i
notice
that
it
is
white
people
who
do
this
i've
tried
and
cannot
figure
out
the
motivation
for
this
why
would
you
try
to
talk
to
the
person
who
has
wronged
you
especially
in
such
an
over
friendly
way
can
anyone
please
give
some
insight
into
this
what's
been
the
deal
with
boetticher
this
year
especially
regarding
that
earlier
confession
about
it
what's
been
happening
1624
i
wish
i
didn't
have
such
a
love
hate
relationship
with
georgetown
why
does
it
have
to
be
so
complicated
1042
unicycle
guy
you
smiled
at
me
outside
the
srb
today
and
my
heart
melted
let
me
take
you
on
a
date
16206
do
girls
at
cornell
find
guys
who
aren't
white
to
be
sexy
attractive
boyfriend
material
if
so
then
why
doesn't
it
seem
apparent
like
i
don't
see
much
interracial
relationships
especially
between
blacks
and
whites
asians
and
blacks
12700
it
is
incredibly
annoying
when
people
stage
whisper
in
the
stacks
seriously
i'm
on
the
sixth
floor
of
olin
and
there
are
so
many
other
places
you
can
go
where
it's
ok
to
talk
while
you
study
please
shut
up
or
leave
are
there
any
attractive
persian
girls
out
there
i
will
take
off
my
boxers
for
a
persian
here's
my
summary
of
the
largely
imaginary
dialog
on
finances
of
the
last
few
years
students
we
need
lots
of
things
but
most
of
all
a
new
hamilton
smith
it
is
literally
falling
apart
also
non
ruinous
state
tuition
that's
not
higher
than
most
private
schools
would
be
nice
administration
we
have
no
money
accepts
check
from
peter
t
paul
for
half
of
a
new
business
school
nobody
asked
for
we're
building
a
business
school
but
it's
okay
because
we'll
raise
all
the
money
raises
literally
zero
money
it's
okay
because
we
can
borrow
all
the
money
and
simply
charge
future
students
which
aren't
real
students
at
all
nh
you
guys
are
fuckwits
we're
cutting
your
allowance
by
half
until
you
stop
blowing
it
on
crack
and
business
schools
hamilton
smith
partially
implodes
burning
students
and
faculty
with
steam
from
ruptured
pipes
students
ahhhh
administration
shut
up
damn
it
we
have
no
money
because
the
legislature
took
it
clinks
champagne
glasses
with
paul
trips
over
a
pile
of
unused
lcds
in
the
new
business
school
fine
we'll
do
it
in
a
few
years
maybe
despite
having
no
money
unh
announces
plans
for
"25,000,000"
stadium
renovation
everyone
wtf
administration
what
do
you
mean
how
are
we
going
to
pay
for
it
there's
money

stadium
nobody

want
to
come
hereeeeeeeeee
rest
of
the
world
we
don't
want

because

ungodly
expensive

if
you
see
them
looking
at
their
phones
and
realize
they
don't
know
where
they
are
walking
why
don't
you
just
move
to
the
side
instead
of
staring
right
at
them
and
walking
into
them
do
you
want
to
be
bumped
into
just
so
you
can
get
mad
what
if
goofy
is
normal
in
his
world
and
pluto
is
his
down
syndromed
brother
that
he
hates
with
a
passion
so
he
treats
him
like
an
animal
if
vdp
is
cancelled
i
will
be
bummed
as
fuck
anyone
know
the
status
of
vdp
to
the
girl
who
wears
a
pink
headband
at
the
rec
we
both
give
each
other
stares
i'd
love
to
talk
but
i
know
from
experience
women
hate
being
hit
on
at
the
gym
what
the
hell
do
i
do
1018
when
i
tell
people
i
don't
party
they
think
i
am
a
social
hermit
who
won't
get
far
in
the
world
because
i
do
not
interact
with
others
but
if
i
told
people
i
party
every
weekend
i
am
automatically
a
party
animal
alcoholic
only
attending
ucsb
because
of
the
party
scene
is
there
going
to
ever
be
a
middle
ground
292
i
literally
saw
some
of
the
most
beautiful
men
i've
ever
seen
in
my
life
last
night
seriously
what
i
wouldn't
give
to
have
the
icebreaker
to
say
hello
to
them
what
can
a
girl
say
to
avoid
being
awkward
i'm
sick
of
bros
what's
the
point
of
even
having
muscles
that
big
i
want
a
strong
fit
guy
who
actually
uses
muscles
for
function
like
running
swimming
climbing
you
know
going
outside
not
living
in
the
gym
i
don't
want
a
protein
obsessed
meat
head
i
want
someone
to
cheer
on
at
races
or
to
bike
around
town
with
why
would
you
falsely
report
that
you
were
assaulted
trying
to
get
two
guys
in
trouble
wtf
is
wrong
with
you
you
could
ruin
their
lives
by
having
them
arrested
for
assault
and
having
that
go
on
their
records
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
but
first
let
me
take
a
selfie
aaaand
then
i
puked
in
the
car
this
song
is
supposed
to
be
a
joke
right
is
there
anywhere
i
can
watch
the
wade
davis
1st
monday
talk
online
can
someone
summarize
this
whole
house
of
cards
episode
of
the
student
senate
with
a
tl
dr
15701
here's
my
message
to
all
of
my
fellow
gentlemen
out
there
rock
your
body
rock
your
image
be
you
being
handsome
means
accepting
your
shape
and
being
confident
in
yourself
why
do
we
constantly
push
ourselves
to
work
out
and
have
abs
like
movie
stars
also
a
lot
of
the
girls
i've
talked
to
have
said
that
they
prefer
their
men
to
have
no
muscles
and
a
tender
personality
stay
sweet
all
you
sexy
males
when
i
was
abroad
the
university
i
attended
also
had
a
confessions
page
some
of
the
posts
were
hilarious
for
example
one
guy
blacked
out
and
his
flatmates
poured
yogurt
all
over
his
bed
to
make
it
look
like
he
blew
his
load
all
over
the
place
i
know
that's
disgusting
but
it
makes
me
laugh
i
believe
that
the
point
of
this
page
is
to
post
things
that
make
people
laugh
isn't
that
what
the
internet
is
all
about
i
truly
wish
that
instead
of
professing
their
anxieties
people
would
just
post
funny
and
gross
stories
about
their
time
at
kenyon
i
understand
that
people
believe
that
they
have
no
one
else
to
talk
to
and
that
there
is
a
sense
of
catharsis
in
expressing
yourself
here
but
i
guarantee
as
someone
who
also
struggles
with
an
anxiety
disorder
and
depression
expressing
yourself
through
this
outlet
only
provides
a
short
lived
form
of
satisfaction
i
would
play
with
a
nice
set
of
testes
all
day
long
if
i
could
there
is
something
so
comforting
about
a
really
squishy
pair
of
balls
nature's
stress
balls
am
i
right
ladies
i'm
in
that
weird
i
don't
want
him
but
i
don't
want
anyone
else
to
have
him
emotional
stage
with
my
ex
does
anyone
know
how
to
get
over
that
feeling
i've
already
unsubscribed
hidden
his
stuff
from
my
news
feed
3271
why
is
it
that
so
many
of
the
really
attractive
guys
here
have
such
small
penises
who's
the
cute
boy
sitting
at
the
loomis
desk
nowadays

my
roommate
is
so
obnoxious
he
has
fights
with
his
girlfriend
over
the
phone
almost
every
single
night
until
4
am
and
he
thinks
he's
being
discreet
by
doing
it
under
the
covers
but
he
ends
up
yelling
and
screaming
at
her
and
i
am
losing
sleep
over
it
because
i
can't
block
out
his
yelling
how
can
i
politely
tell
him
to
take
it
outside
or
do
it
somewhere
where
i
don't
have
to
lose
sleep
over
his
relationship
issues
wait
someone
actually
monitors
can
see
what
we
do
on
tigernet
would
someone
that
knows
about
this
explain
it
in
more
detail
please
that
very
awkward
moment
when
your
friend
becomes
born
again
christian
and
gets
a
new
boyfriend
but
instead
of
transforming
she
starts
acting
giving
you
one
word
closed
responses
blowing
you
off
and
rolling
her
eyes
at
you
when
she
thought
you
were
not
looking
i
am
a
believer
and
try
to
live
right
but
i
am
not
a
missionary
nor
do
i
post
bible
verses
on
fb
but
what
the
hell
did
i
do
to
deserve
all
that
i
feel
like
i'm
locking
myself
in
the
friend
zone
with
you
and
i
can't
make
it
stop
why
can't
i
be
less

i
broke
up
with
my
ex
on
new
year's
eve
so
i
could
sleep
with
another
guy
and
because
he
was
28
and
still
on
his
mom's
tit
he
gave
half
his
paycheck
to
her
every
week
she
would
constantly
invite
herself
on
our
dates
and
pop
in
whenever
she
wanted
he
gave
her
a
new
paint
job
on
her
truck
for
her
birthday
and
got
me
a
stuffed
animal
really
i
saw
where
i
ranked
and
ran
however
here's
the
bright
side
i
still
use
his
netflix
account
to
watch
all
my
shows
because
he's
too
dumb
to
change
the
password
boo
yah
take
that
momma's
boy
9007
i
was
on
the
verge
of
finally
asking
you
out
and
a
few
small
things
happened
one
big
thing
happened
and
long
story
short
i
feel
like
i
cant
ask
you
out
before
the
end
of
the
year
fuck
me
right

i
just
got
back
from
studying
abroad
my
roommate
and
i
walked
around
town
at
night
and
spotted
a
massage
parlor
we
thought
it
was
sketchy
when
they
told
us
to
change
into
paper
boxers
20
for
one
45
minute
session
were
we
happy
in
the
end
yes
to
make
myself
clear
i
do
not
hate
homosexuals
and
anybody
who
acts
violently
toward
them
is
committing
a
graver
sin
than
the
homosexuals
themselves
there
are
several
admitted
homosexuals
in
my
congregation
most
churches
forbid
homosexuals
to
worship
but
we
worked
out
a
deal
with
the
four
men
and
two
women
who
engage
in
homosexual
acts
they
are
deathly
afraid
of
the
hellfire
that
awaits
them
in
the
next
life
so
we
arranged
to
have
them
sit
behind
a
curtain
while
the
church
is
in
session
some
of
the
older
people
are
not
comfortable
so
the
homosexuals
must
leave
though
the
back
of
the
church
every
sunday
we
have
an
hour
of
praying
away
the
gay
so
that
these
people
will
be
able
to
hopefully
cure
their
sinful
disease
and
live
righteously
we
usually
sing
hymns
and
read
scripture
that
guides
them
away
from
their
disgusting
acts
one
of
the
lesbians
has
not
been
with
another
woman
in
two
years
at
least
we've
had
one
success
i
firmly
believe
that
this
is
the
way
that
we
should
deal
with
the
homosexual
problem
in
our
society
progressively
some
churches
simply
banish
those
people
and
do
not
allow
them
to
partake
in
worship
how
does
that
cure
the
problem
i
suggest
more
churches
embrace
homosexuals
like
we
do
and
help
them
overcome
their
disability
why
can't
i
find
a
girl
that
likes
wwe
it's
totally
cool
to
walk
up
and
pet
the
crozier
cat
right
because
sometimes
i
need
to
pet
a
cat
freshman
guy
who
looks
like
orlando
bloom
and
sorta
talks
with
an
accent
who
are
you
833
sometimes
i
want
to
comment
something
intellectual
or
thought
provoking
on
youtube
or
facebook
posts
but
there
are
so
much
trolling
and
flames
around
people
are
so
indifferent
to
the
degree
of
almost
neglecting
rationality
that
i
would
usually
just
close
the
tab
and
go
cry
in
a
corner
thinking
of
humanity's
fate
instead
yes
i
just
wrote
all
that
in
one
sentence
is
that
a
run
on
sentence
o
lc
grammar
nazis
15280
the
world
should
not
come
to
accepting
homosexuality
as
a
norm
in
society
i
wish
people
would
stop
treating
it
as
a
civil
rights
issue
no
one
is
born
gay
there
is
no
gay
gene
there
are
certain
incidents
in
one's
life
that
may
push
him
her
to
question
their
sexual
orientation
be
it
a
rough
childhood
or
whatever
it
is
we
were
made
to
procreate
it
is
only
right
and
homosexuality
is
unnatural
no
one
can
dispute
that
for
those
of
you
who
are
unaware
homosexuality
is
how
aids
came
to
be
people
can
say
why
does
it
bother
you
if
they
don't
bother
you
leave
it
alone
and
its
none
of
your
business
well
it
is
my
business
because
i
don't
want
to
be
a
member
of
a
society
where
health
issues
in
the
future
may
become
rampant
because
of
our
open
mindedness
also
if
they
function
as
a
progressive
member
of
society
and
are
productive
and
contributing
to
our
well
being
why
does
it
matter
if
they're
gay
it
matters
because
it
is
a
health
issue
i
think
homosexuality
is
a
psychological
issue
and
just
like
all
others
it
can
be
cured
it
destroys
how
families
are
supposed
to
be
structured
homosexual
activists
attempt
to
portray
their
lifestyles
as
normal
and
healthy
hollywood
and
the
media
relentlessly
propagate
the
image
of
the
fit
healthy
and
well
adjusted
homosexual
while
the
reality
is
quite
the
opposite
instability
and
promiscuity
typically
characterize
homosexual
relationships
these
two
factors
increase
the
incidence
of
serious
and
incurable
stds
please
stop
giving
these
activists
carte
blanche
it
is
unnatural
and
unhygienic
admin
quit
being
a
butt
gonorrhea
and
herpes
cold
sores
are
uncurable
stds
and
straights
pass
them
all
over
the
place
and
if
homosexuality
is
curable
why
isn't
homophobia
and
your
obnoxious
misplaced
concern
for
lifestyles
that
need
less
than
none
of
your
input
how
many
of
yall
get
away
with
not
paying
a
pet
deposit
702
ever
since
i've
been
to
ucsb
as
an
international
student
some
people
would
ask
me
where
i'm
from
and
sometimes
i
blend
in
and
no
one
would
notice
for
some
reason
the
next
question
that
follows
is
are
you
a
prince
i'm
honest
so
i
tell
them
no
but
for
some
reason
no
one
seems
to
believe
that
and
they
still
think
that
i'm
a
prince
can't
say
this
is
a
bad
thing
so
i
stopped
caring
and
decided
to
go
with
the
flow
guys
of
unh
don't
have
a
date
for
valentines
day
fear
not
former
teen
mom
farrah
abraham
is
having
a
new
sex
tape
drop
this
thursday
enjoy
it
i
know
i
will
which
is
the
best
massage
place
in
college
station
13219
so
i
met
this
girl
and
we've
hung
out
a
few
times
and
i
can
tell
she
had
fun
i
held
her
hand
during
a
movie
and
she
seemed
into
me
however
she
later
told
me
she
just
wanted
to
be
friends
i
can't
stop
thinking
about
her
we
haven't
hung
out
since
she
told
me
she
wanted
to
be
friends
but
whenever
we
see
each
other
she
always
says
hi
enthusiastically
i
am
resisting
the
urge
to
text
her
because
i
don't
want
to
seem
too
desperate
should
i
ask
her
out
on
a
date
or
am
i
stuck
in
the
friend
zone
can
someone
tell
me
what
to
do
i
really
like
her
and
i
feel
like
i
shouldn't
give
up
that
easily
however
i
don't
want
to
force
anything
i
have
completed
every
survey
unh
has
emailed
me
yet
i
have
never
won
a
single
prize
they
fuckin
with
me
15273
i
am
gay
and
i
have
to
admit
when
i
was
first
coming
to
terms
with
myself
i
realized
i
was
not
100
comfortable
with
gay
culture
and
people
i
felt
incredibly
out
of
place
because
i
knew
i
was
gay
but
i
wasn't
comfortable
with
other
gays
i
had
a
plethora
of
prejudices
about
the
people
who
shared
my
sexuality
i
thought
i'd
never
date
a
guy
who
was
feminine
i
swore
to
myself
that
i'd
break
the
gay
mold
and
be
a
jock
that
was
awesome
at
whatever
sport
he
did
i'd
chill
with
the
bros
love
football
and
be
quite
indifferent
to
all
the
gay
hullabaloo
i
wanted
everyone
to
see
and
know
that
gay
wasn't
all
that
bad
i
wanted
people
to
see
that
gay
could
be
normal
i
thought
i
was
purporting
a
better
image
for
the
average
gay
male
but
it
hit
me
one
day
i
was
just
as
worse
as
the
right
most
republican
condemning
any
gay
lifestyle
i
was
so
uncomfortable
with
myself
that
i
was
doing
everything
i
could
to
fit
my
sexuality
in
a
hetero
mold
that
the
vast
majority
of
society
would
find
acceptable
i
tried
to
suppress
every
thought
and
action
that
was
too
gay
so
that
people
would
find
me
more
acceptable
well
truth
is
i'm
not
hetero
and
i
shouldn't
be
trying
to
force
my
sexuality
into
a
manner
that
appeases
the
masses
gay
is
gay
whether
someone
is
stereotypical
gay
or
an
unconventional
gay
what
does
it
matter
all
hetero
people
are
not
the
same
why
should
gays
be
and
who
am
i
to
judge
who
is
anyone
to
judge
every
single
person
is
different
and
gay
is
just
one
innate
characteristic
of
billions
i
guess
my
point
is
no
matter
if
you're
gay
or
straight
acceptance
isn't
always
something
we're
born
with
so
if
someone
admits
they're
uncomfortable
around
any
walk
of
life
it
doesn't
immediately
mean
they're
a
bigot
people
need
time
and
exposure
to
foster
understanding
even
us
gays
who
most
would
assume
are
naturally
accepting
of
all
races
as
long
as
we
make
strides
to
reach
a
sense
of
solidarity
it
means
our
hearts
are
sincere
sometimes
people
need
time
is
all
so
don't
go
shouting
suppression
and
injustice
if
someone
doesn't
catch
on
right
away
instead
try
to
ease
they're
discomfort
show
them
you're
a
person
as
well
and
our
differences
are
what
makes
a
unique
beauty
because
condemnation
will
get
us
nowhere
what
happened
to
kappa
sigma
they
are
lamer
then
ever
this
year

i
just
took
photos
of
every
single
confession
about
the
blonde
and
the
peeper
now
what
do
i
do
with
them
girl
you
are
making
a
terrible
mistake
we
can
all
tell
that
you're
just
dating
him
because
you
want
a
boyfriend
any
boyfriend
but
guess
what
i
don't
care
how
you
fuck
up
your
own
life
anymore
here's
some
advice
if
you're
sexually
assaulted
then
report
that
shit
it's
like
if
someone
breaks
into
your
house
are
you
gonna
just
let
them
get
away
with
it
no
send
their
ass
to
jail
if
you
don't
they're
gonna
do
it
to
someone
else
because
they
can
get
away
with
it
what's
your
secret
share
it
on
the
free
whisper
app
hey
ares
and
chronos
how
many
snapchats
do
you
get
a
day
3413
how
many
more
kates
and
emilys
does
georgetown
need
why
should
i
have
to
ask
for
an
extra
garlic
sauce
where
the
cute
gay
boys
at
i
was
walking
back
to
williamson
today
after
class
and
the
wind
was
blowing
my
hair
everywhere
you
could
tell
i
was
definitely
struggling
all
of
a
sudden
a
guy
walks
up
from
behind
me
and
says
with
a
laugh
and
the
weather
had
been
so
nice
just
a
few
days
ago
with
just
that
simple
statement
we
started
walking
and
talking
and
joking
around
all
the
way
back
to
willy
the
conversation
was
very
surface
based
but
it
was
the
initiation
that
i
was
so
impressed
by
huge
props
to
this
guy
that
was
able
to
approach
a
total
stranger
and
create
a
conversation
out
of
thin
air
so
many
times
we
walk
around
with
our
heads
down
avoiding
eye
contact
at
all
costs
but
why
maybe
it's
because
we
think
the
other
person
will
look
at
us
like
a
weirdo
for
initiating
anything
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
realize
how
much
i
appreciate
people
who
go
out
of
their
way
to
just
be
genuinely
friendly
i
think
every
once
in
a
while
we
should
get
outside
of
our
comfort
zones
and
simply
smile
at
one
another
complement
their
outfit
or
even
strike
up
a
simple
conversation
about
the
weather
what's
the
worst
that
can
happen
here's
the
situation
my
best
friend
and
i
have
been
best
friends
since
high
school
he
has
another
best
friend
he's
known
longer
elementary
but
they
aren't
as
close
over
the
last
few
years
so
we
are
closer
my
friends
getting
married
and
its
going
to
be
a
joint
best
man
thing
i'm
fucking
pissed
here's
the
kicker
the
other
friend
didn't
even
tell
my
friend
he
was
going
to
have
a
baby
with
his
wife
what
the
fuck
doesn't
that
show
he's
a
dick
and
shouldn't
be
considered
am
i
overreacting
or
do
i
have
a
right
to
be
pissed
what
are
some
apartments
that
are
under
or
around
500
it
really
only
has
to
be
livable
doesnt
need
to
be
anything
spectacular
or
good
for
that
matter
but
its
nice
to
have
anybody
selling
kendrick
tickets
hi
rice
students
i
am
honestly
ashamed
of
my
school
uh
and
all
the
idiots
they
admit
now
i
see
on
our
confession
page
that
they
are
trying
to
come
and
troll
your
page
lol
and
i
see
what
they
say
so
ghetto
you
guys
are
smarter
and
the
better
school
i
don't
know
why
the
ghetto
kids
don't
see
this

i
was
smart

rice

classy
last
night
while
my
roommate's

got
butt
naked
for
my
ex
first
time
ever
and
masturbated
on
my
carpet
floor
for
him
on
cam
it
was
soooo
sexy
but
i
couldn't
make
myself
cum
if
he
talks
dirty
to
me
i
can
cum
problem
is
he
was
talking
dirty
about
something
that
grosses
me
out
not
turns
me
on
i
was
too
afraid
to
say
anything
while
it
was
happening
but
i
made
him
cum
instantly
when
i
talked
dirty
to
him
i'm
sooo
horny
now

tips
on
what
i
can

you
know
the
saying
if
you
love
something
let
it
go
well
i'm
letting
you
go
one
day
at
a
time
more
and
more
you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
if
you
feel
the
same
way
once
you're
gone
you'll
find
your
way
back
if
you
never
return
i'll
know
what
i've
always
feared
is
true
we
will
never
work

to
the
girl
hula
hooping
outside
of
olin
you
are
bomb
how
do
you
do
that
also
what
are
you
listening
to
so
much
rhythm
you
go
girl
i
feel
like
i'm
at
cirque
du
soleil

think
northwestern
is
lowkey
lying
about
all
the
survey
for
ipad
giveways
i
mean
how
many
ipads
can
one
school
giveaway
and
has
anyone
actually
ever
won
one
or
knew
anyone
who
won
one
i
think
not
illuminati
i
feel
like
girls
are
intimidated
by
the
way
i
look
once
you
get
past
the
muscles
i
am
the
most
caring
person
youll
ever
meet
i
get
the
youre
hot
comment
all
the
time
but
i
think
every
girl

a
man
whore
when

not
the
case
at
all
so
where
are
the
women
who
want
a
sweet
strong
man
in
their
life
d
let
me
just
start
off
by
saying
that
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
the
girls
who
are
naturally
small
and
or
go
to
the
gym
every
day
but
i
am
so
goddamn
sick
of
being
told
that
i'm
not
skinny
enough
all
these
ads
are
telling
me
what
pills
to
take
to
curb
cravings
and
how
i
can
get
that
perfect
bikini
body
i'm
supposed
to
have
a
thigh
gap
and
a
bikini
bridge
well
you
know
what
f
it
i
will
go
to
the
gym
when
i
feel
like
it
and
when
i
have
time
i
will
eat
chicken
wings
for
lunch
if
i
fucking
want
to
even
if
i
did
eat
salads
all
the
time
and
went
to
the
gym
every
day
i
wouldn't
be
a
size
2
i'm
just
not
built
that
way
when
i
was
in
the
best
shape
of
my
life
i
was
a
size
4
and
yes
i
have
gained
some
weight
since
starting
college
but
who
hasn't
i'm
done
feeling
inadequate
i
will
no
longer
be
defined
by
what
size
jeans
i
wear
fuck
the
society
that
tells
me
i
have
to
be
tiny
to
be
beautiful
everyone
is
beautiful
from
size
0
to
size
infinity
don't
ever
let
anyone
fucking
tell
you
different
rant
over
i
keep
trying
but
i
know
i
cant
make
my
girlfriend
to
orgasm
or
squirt
how
could
i
achieve
it
question
from
a
perspective
male
student
how
easy
is
it
to
get
laid
at
cc
like
if
your
a
virgin
you
kmow
what
sucks
falling
for
someone
who
doesnt
even
know
i
exist
what's
your
secret

free
whisper
app
12272
there's
a
girl
i've
liked
for
months
now
and
we
are
very
good
friends
i
know
its
the
end
of
the
year
but
i
can't
stop
thinking
about
her
and
i'm
considering
sending
her
a
farewell
text
letting
her
know
how
i
feel
and
how
i'm
going
to
try
for
her
next
year
i
think
it
could
be
really
romantic
and
awesome
but
could
also
backfire
ladies
what
do
you
think
9728
why
is
it
that
when
i
finally
find
a
guy
that
likes
me
for
me
flaws
and
all
he
has
to
live
in
another
state
whyyyyyyyy
is
this
a
test
1080
i
gotta
confess
nate
tisa
makes
me
wish
i
was
a
gay
man
can
i
at
least
be
your
beard
when
you're
ready
to
settle
down
i
would
cook
you
dinner
and
be
your
perfect
little
housewife
and
you
could
still
fuck
the
sexy
latino
pool
boy
i'm
stooooooked
to
jam
the
fuck
out
to
nelly
and
it
baffled
me
how
other
people
weren't
on
the
same
page
until
i
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
these
people
just
aren't
a
good
time
like
don't
take
yourselves
so
seriously
nelly
is
going
to
be
the
biggest
party
unh
has
ever
seen
we
all
know
his
songs
how
much
better
can
it
get
1236
it
would
be
cool
if
people
were
attracted
to
my
body
type
without
it
being
considered
a
fetish
is
that
a
thing
can
we
make
that
a
thing
this
morning
when
i
walked
into
my
german
class
my
heart
was
heavy
with
the
memory
of
the
tragic
events
that
occurred
on
this
day
one
of
my
classmates
asked
how
my
day
was
going
and
i
responded
that
i
was
very
sad
when
he
asked
why
i
reminded
him
that
today
is
september
11th
a
day
that
is
universally
mourned
by
our
country
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
took
in
my
words
before
looking
out
the
window
at
the
sunshine
and
responding
simply
yeah
but
today
can
still
be
a
good
day
and
you
know
what
he's
right
thank
you
for
reminding
me
that
even
though
we
still
grieve
those
who
were
lost
the
darkness
doesn't
last
forever
i'm
a
freshman
engineering
major
and
absolutely
cannot
see
myself
being
an
engineer
so
i'm
switching
to
communications
asap
now
i
can't
decide
whether
it's
worth
it
to
q
drop
2
classes
and
be
in
g
stud
for
a
semester
or
q
drop
3
and
go
straight
into
comm
a
little
help
i
randomly
found
this
confession
page
great
by
the
way
hey
so
what
does
cc
stand
for
cerritos
college
help
lol
11229
i
honestly
dunno
why
the
fws
professor
is
thinking
does
she
honestly
think
that
we
are
fucking
historians
fuck
that
history
fws

i've
had
such
a
hard
time
finding
friends
here
who
i
really
fit
in
with
i
do
have
friends
and
they're
nice
people
but
i
just
feel
like
i
don't
connect
with
them
the
same
way
i
have
with
friends
from
high
school
i
don't
really
think
time
is
the
issue
anymore
i
feel
like
i
don't
fit
in
with
the
culture
at
cornell
that
the
most
visible
people
tend
to
either
be
really
fratty
or
too
antisocial
to
want
to
hang
out
regularly
and
that
it's
hard
to
find
people
who
are
somewhere
in
the
middle
people
here
stick
and
arguably
are
most
comfortable
with
their
ethnic
groups
there
are
also
people
here
who
act
like
they've
made
all
the
friends
they
need
and
that
they
don't
need
any
more
despite
being
here
less
than
a
year
how
can
i
find
people
i
fit
in
better
with
i've
joined
clubs
but
people
don't
meet
outside
of
those
meetings
my
dorm
is
very
cliquey
i
have
to
admit
that
i
had
some
adjustment
issues
first
semester
but
i've
always
been
friendly
proactive
and
tried
to
fit
in
i've
never
had
social
issues
before
coming
here
and
am
starting
to
doubt
that
it's
my
fault
i've
been
accepted
into
the
gateway
program
how
is
it
567
i
used
to
be
okay
with
hooking
up
casually
with
a
collection
of
guys
lately
though
i've
been
feeling
a
bit
empty
about
it
then
i
read
that
confession
about
the
herpes
which
further
disturbed
and
spooked
me
i'm
highly
rethinking
my
lifestyle
i
think
it's
time
to
close
the
curtains
on
casual
sex
for
me
i
don't
really
mind
being
lonely
anyway
who
needs
men
when
you
have
a
really
good
vibrator
how
do
the
admins
feel
about
getting
sexy
snapchats
let's
broaden
that
how
do
guys
in
general
feel
about
getting
sexy
snapchats
from
a
girl
even
though
i'm
a
christian
i
support
laws
allowing
gay
marriage
in
the
united
states
while
the
bible
condemns
homosexuality
as
a
sin
we
live
in
a
nation
that
bases
itself
on
freedom
of
religion
and
the
right
to
pursue
happiness.god
gave
man
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
follow
christ
as
the
lord
and
savior
so
why
should
man
try
to
deny
the
choice
of
homosexuality
for
others
sad
stori
me
better
check
my
phone
for
girls
to
text
to
ask
to
the
last
midnight
yell
me
checks
phone
me
better
find
some
girls
to
ask
to
the
last
midnight
yell
considering
im
usually
i
am
a
giant
pussy
with
girls
i
decided
casually
crip
walk
to
the
msc
because
everyone
knows
that
gangsters
arent
pussies
so
there
i
was
at
the
msc
single
and
ready
to
get
nervous
around
anyone
i
found
attractive
walked
over
to
starbucks
to
get
a
bomb
ass
latte
and
in
front
of
me
was
the
most
beautiful
white
girl
in
yoga
pants
ive
ever
seen
just
as
i
was
about
to
say
uh
so
listen
can
i
hav
ya
numba
it
was
her
turn
to
order
she
proceeded
to
order
a
triple
mocha
dark
chocolate
ugg
boot
raspberry
white
iphone
5
double
caramel
infinity
sign
frappe
shit
you
not
she
actually
ordered
that
the
out
of
nowhere
a
wild
frauche
a
frat
douche
bag
walks
up
to
her
and
grabs
her
hand
and
she
let
him
so
i
did
my
mean
ass
crip
walk
to
about
10
feet
from
them
and
yelled
in
my
best
samuel
l
jackson
voice
hey
mothafucka
dont
hold
the
hands
with
the
girl
i
secretly
like
do
i
look
like
a
bitch
i
am
fiji
water
and
you
are
pond
water
i
think
i
frightened
him
because
he
didn't
respond
or
probably
because
i
actually
yelled
it
in
my
head
so
now
i
am
sad
here
i
sit
downstairs
at
the
msc
defeated
and
my
relationship
status
is
holy
shit
im
awkward
hold
up
is
that
the
most
beautiful
latina
i've
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
what's
with
all
the
posts
about
men
with
small
penises
and
large
trucks
is
it
little
dick
big
truck
awareness
month
or
something
i
love
british
accents
where
are
the
british
guys
in
cs
i
want
one
why
are
people
so
stupid
on
the
road
these
days
don't
pull
out
in
front
of
someone
that
is
going
the
speed
limit
and
than
drive
30
below
it
once
you
cut
them
off
don't
text
and
drive
don't
drink
and
drive
don't
play
on
your
phone
and
mess
with
your
kids
books
or
whatever
it
is
you
think
you
can
mess
with
while
you
are
driving
and
don't
act
like
an
idiot
when
confronted
by
the
one
you
cut
off
and
threaten
to
beat
up
a
female
because
she
did
that
just
makes
you
look
like
a
pussy
of
a
man
that
shouldn't
have
ever
been
born
in
other
words
your
momma
should
have
swallowed
your
sorry
fucking
ass
piece
of
shit
i
know
that
junior
year
is
the
ideal
year
to
go
abroad
and
that's
why
everyone
leaves
then
but
sometimes
to
me
it
seems
like
junior
year
is
when
people
kind
of
start
needing
a
little
time
away
is
it
just
me
