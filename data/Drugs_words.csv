occasionally
i
smoke
when
i
drink
turn
off
don't
care
drinking
most
nights
5454
i'm
the
cunt
suitemate
from
secret
5441
calling
me
that
was
pretty
childish
but
i
get
that
you're
mad
you
were
out
of
your
mind
drunk
and
probably
don't
remember
what
actually
happened
so
you
may
think
that
you
did
nothing
wrong
let
me
remind
you
you
were
moaning
crying
and
yelling
in
my
common
room
for
awhile
until
you
brought
that
and
your
bottomless
stomach
of
vomit
to
my
bathroom
for
hours
more
despite
repeated
bargaining
with
you
can
we
take
you
to
the
hospital
can
we
take
you
to
your
own
room
you
wouldn't
leave
after
some
debating
i
called
the
r.a
once
she
came
to
the
room
you
admitted
not
only
to
being
very
drunk
but
to
also
having
smoked
weed
which
generally
suppresses
vomiting
so
you
were
probably
way
sicker
than
i
imagined
i
didn't
know
that
the
rest
of
this
was
going
to
happen
to
you
and
i
didn't
call
the
r.a
to
spite
you
you
didn't
even
know
it
was
me
until
you
called
my
roommate
to
ask
who
it
was
earlier
today
i
might
have
said
that
i
was
sorry
but
you
turned
this
into
a
name
calling
pity
party
so
now
i
don't
care
please
don't
come
back
to
my
room
how
long
after
you
graduate
can
you
keep
up
your
college
drinking
habits
until
you're
declared
an
alcoholic
i
just
don't
think
i
can
handle
the
real
world
731
it
sickens
me
how
people
glorify
getting
blackout
drunk
you're
proud
of
getting
so
hammered
that
you
literally
can't
remember
pieces
of
or
your
entire
night
you're
okay
with
using
it
as
an
excuse
to
whore
yourself
out
how
does
that
at
all
seem
healthy
god
dammit
have
some
self
respect
people
so
i
have
this
friend
i
drugged
him
to
induce
seizures
and
time
loss
but
i
did
it
for
the
right
reason
you
know
like
i
wasn't
gonna
go
to
prison
anyway
he
sends
this
person
to
investigate
me
and
they
find
the
organs
so
i
had
to
kill
them
it
was
a
delicious
and
unexpected
surprise
what
do
i
do
now
no
school
where's
the
brews
at
632
i
hate
the
normal
awkward
georgetown
parties
if
you
need
to
keep
a
beer
pong
table
out
so
awkward
people
have
a
place
to
stand
and
do
nothing
then
you
suck
at
throwing
a
party
put
the
fucking
beer
pong
table
away
once
the
music
starts
popping
guys
need
to
do
more
than
just
grabbing
girls
hips
and
going
side
to
side
like
its
a
fucking
8th
grade
dance
girls
need
to
bounce
their
asses
more
and
shouldn't
need
to
get
drunk
to
get
comfortable
fuck
everyone
guys
and
girls
who
makes
a
disgusted
face
when
people
are
getting
their
groove
on
just
because
your
awkward
ass
does
nothing
but
stand
by
the
keg
all
night
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
ruin
the
fun
for
everyone
else
to
the
honies
flash
your
tits
why
does
no
one
do
this
because
we
love
to
fucking
label
people
as
hoe
or
skank
they're
just
boobs
people
we
all
love
them
wear
skanky
things
feel
sexy
enjoy
yourselves
to
the
boys
please
make
something
nice
to
drink
other
than
your
fucking
kegs
and
jungle
juices
there
are
classy
ladies
here
who
aren't
looking
for
10
beers
flash
yo
abs
if
you
want
work
out
dudes
don't
be
creepy
and
don't
force
anything
on
girls
i
don't
give
a
fuck
what
your
major
is
i
don't
give
a
fuck
what
school
your
in
i
don't
give
a
fuck
about
how
many
midterms
you
have
learn
to
have
a
real
conversation

late
one
night
last
semester
i
walked
a
girl
home
who
was
sobbing
she
was
also
super
drunk
was
it
you
1535
the
other
day
my
roommate
and
i
had
to
get
our
room
lock
changed
because
a
suite
mate
stole
our
keys
the
locksmith
let
himself
in
unexpectedly
and
saw
an
eighth
of
greens
on
our
common
room
table
instead
of
reporting
us
he
said
it's
just
a
little
herb
what's
that
going
to
do
to
you
then
he
proceeded
to
help
us
cover
our
smoke
detector
as
well
as
offer
to
smoke
us
down
to
say
the
very
least
getting
our
locks
changed
was
a
great
time
maybe
we
should
do
it
more
often
so
i
have
no
date
for
valentines
day
and
i
couldn't
care
less
what
does
upset
me
is
that
i
hardly
have
any
friends
and
the
friends
i
do
have
all
have
dates
so
i
have
nothing
to
do
its
not
that
im
not
social
im
outgoing
and
talk
to
people
all
the
time
i
just
dont
drink
and
pretty
much
anytime
i
go
hang
out
with
no
people
they
get
obliterated
drunk
and
never
leave
me
alone
regarding
the
fact
that
i
refuse
to
drink
so
i
stop
hanging
out
with
them
i
have
yet
to
make
a
single
friend
that
i
didnt
know
prior
to
moving
here
i
only
have
out
with
about
6
people
iys
like
there
is
no
one
in
cstat
who
will
just
hang
out
go
grab
a
bite
to
eat
and
just
have
a
night
at
home
with
friends
i
dont
wanna
get
shit
faced
every
night
anyone
out
there
who
would
just
hang
out
with
a
freshman
guy
play
some
xbox
or
just
go
out
for
some
lunch
or
something
justice
served
so
last
night
after
being
a
good
little
wildcat
and
studying
all
night
my
drunk
roommates
come
home
with
the
munchies
and
we
all
whisk
off
to
d
hop
being
the
only
sober
person
on
main
street
is
always
entertaining
and
last
proved
to
be
no
exception
no
sooner
do
we
sit
down
in
mama
macs
to
enjoy
our
pizza
do
my
roommates
dissolve
into
laughter
about
who
even
knows
what
start
loudly
quoting
movies
and
generally
making
a
harmless
yet
loud
fools
of
them
selves
naturally
this
escalated
to
gummy
bears
being
tossed
around
and
it
was
just
about
time
to
go
so
this
shout
out
goes
to
the
bitch
behind
us
i
will
sit
there
and
listen
to
you
complain
about
how
loud
we
are
it
wasn't
thursday
night
at
midnight
or
anything
and
how
annoying
we
are
god
who
has
the
audacity
to
laugh
these
days
and
how
immature
we
are
guilty
my
roommate
had
gummy
bears
up
her
nose
but
you
mother
fucker
i
will
be
god
damned
when
you
call
them
stupid
bitches
only
after
they
walk
out
mind
you
if
you
think
i'm
not
going
to
get
pissed
but
my
real
breaking
point
you
do
not
call
my
girls
sluts
so
listen
up
first
of
all
get
over
yourself
you're
out
on
a
thursday
night
at
drunk
biddy
central
of
the
universe
stuffy
your
own
grumpy
little
face
if
you
wanted
a
quiet
dinner
get
your
drunk
munchies
elsewhere
secondly
if
you're
going
to
say
something
say
it
to
they're
face
and
not
as
they
walk
out
the
door
i'm
sorry
you're
a
pussy
grow
some
balls
third
before
you
call
someone
who
is
wearing
jeans
sperry's
and
a
sweatshirt
a
slut
maybe
you
should
adjust
your
miniskirt
and
tiny
tank
top
so
you
little
12
year
old
bits
fall
out
no
one
wants
to
see
your
pathetic
a
cups
which
brings
me
to
the
next
point
i'm
really
really
sorry
that
the
only
guy
that
wants
to
go
out
with
you
looks
like
an
anorexic
8
year
old
prep
punk
and
when
he
tell
me
that
i
should
get
my
ass
in
the
gym
yeah
i'm
going
to
be
one
rip
shit
5'2
fit
as
hell
pissed
off
blonde
oh
an
to
that
asshole
since
i
was
afraid
you
would
blow
over
the
next
time
the
wind
picked
up
i
suggest
you
shut
the
fuck
up
so
a
big
shout
out
to
all
the
girls
out
there
that
have
their
girls
backs
and
to
those
bitches
at
mama
mac's
last
night
fuck
off
i'm
so
tired
of
mortal
men
asking
me
hey
you
wanna
cop
some
blow
like
no
the
fuck
what
are
we
in
the
neolithic
age
grow
up
and
smoke
dmt
like
a
god
2595
back
home
i
devil
stick
spin
poi
make
jewelry
jam
out
and
get
stoned
as
a
boulder
i
believe
that
astrology
has
significance
and
talk
about
shit
that
most
people
here
never
care
to
listen
to
i
believe
knowing
someone's
vibes
aura
and
spirit
are
more
important
than
what
major
they
are
or
how
classes
are
going
i
use
drugs
to
understand
nature
and
life
but
here
i
get
judged
for
just
toking
one
here
it
always
amazes
me
how
people
drive
themselves
insane
learning
what's
on
the
prelim
yet
don't
take
two
seconds
to
stop
and
think
about
the
intricacies
of
our
universe
they
marvel
at
the
wonders
of
scientist
and
philosophers
of
the
past
whilst
shaming
and
ridiculing
using
emotional
and
psychedelic
experiences
as
a
method
for
discovery
believing
in
and
reassuring
our
culture's
stigma
against
substances
that
cause
one
to
question
the
very
essence
of
being
accepting
these
rules
as
good
choices
because
self
discovery
would
be
too
risky
back
home
i
have
deeper
conversations
than
any
i've
heard
here
i
grow
as
a
person
from
my
daily
interactions
with
the
people
around
me
here
i
waste
away
studying
beating
the
mean
and
being
closed
out
by
people
who
are
too
busy
to
take
a
trip
outside
their
comfort
zones
and
expand
their
way
of
thinking
when
did
you
all
forsake
yourselves
who
the
fuck
is
actually
going
to
stop
drinking
hard
liquor
when
they
ban
it
2958
i'm
so
sick
of
students
taking
adderall
when
they
do
not
have
a
prescription
it's
not
fair
how
can
someone
live
with
themselves
and
feel
accomplished
by
cheating
who
else
wants
to
start
a
marijuana
legalization
club
we
can
just
sit
around
and
talk
about
how
awesome
weed
is
stoned
as
shit
of
course
i'm
a
straight
female
who
has
noticed
that
the
the
females
at
unh
are
a
lot
better
looking
than
most
of
the
males
here
when
i
get
drunk
i'm
bicurious
like
most
biddies
and
the
guys
love
it
when
i
make
out
with
gorgeous
ladies
would
they
still
cheer
me
on
if
i
wanted
to
marry
one
of
them
5815
i
find
the
cigarette
smoking
here
absolutely
ridiculous
you
could
be
one
dumb
fuck
and
still
know
that
smoking
cigarettes
is
undoubtedly
bad
for
you
i
understand
if
you
come
from
europe
and
have
been
doing
it
for
a
few
years
but
for
those
kids
who
come
here
and
start
doing
it
to
look
cool
well
news
flash
you're
not
you
are
filling
your
lungs
with
garbage
and
making
your
breath
and
clothes
smell
no
one
is
going
to
want
to
kiss
you
not
to
mention
is
lung
cancer
worth
it
seriously
people
go
smoke
some
damn
pot
what
do
you
women
think
about
guys
who
smoke
weed
turn
off
turn
on
neutral
theres
plenty
of
people
who
drink
alcohol
but
not
everyone
likes
to
go
to
the
park
after
dark
and
smoke
that
tumbleweed
i
always
feel
really
left
out
because
i
don't
drink
unh
students
who
don't
party
are
more
harshly
judged
than
those
who
get
black
out
every
weekend
why
3070
when
i
smoke
pot
i
get
extremely
paranoid
like
beyond
belief
the
other
night
i
smoked
with
some
friends
before
going
to
a
restaurant
and
there
was
a
40
minute
wait
for
a
table
while
standing
and
waiting
people
kept
giving
me
strange
looks
and
moving
away
from
me
and
for
some
reason
i
was
convinced
i
shit
my
pants
i
quickly
dipped
out
and
started
walking
down
the
street
for
a
place
to
check
myself
out
while
hundreds
of
people
kept
laughing
at
me
and
giving
me
strange
looks
my
phone
was
dead
i
was
too
high
to
tell
where
i
was
and
i
probably
circled
the
block
20
times
i
spotted
a
guy
waiting
to
get
buzzed
into
a
building
and
quickly
ran
across
the
street
as
i
followed
him
in
he
turned
around
and
stared
me
up
and
down
what
are
you
doing
i
live
here
oh
ok
he
went
upstairs
and
i
searched
for
a
possible
bathroom
or
private
area
on
the
ground
floor
to
check
myself
out
i
found
a
door
next
to
the
stairs
and
quickly
leaped
for
it
i
opened
the
door
shut
it
and
turned
around
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
kitchen
of
some
restaurant
connected
to
the
building
what
the
fuck
how
did
you
get
in
here
i
shut
the
door
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
headed
back
towards
the
entrance
hallway
the
guy
that
let
me
into
the
building
came
walking
down
the
stairs
stopped
and
looked
me
up
and
down
again
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
live
here
or
not
is
there
a
bathroom
around
here
i
don't
think
so
i
took
a
deep
breath
realizing
i
was
out
of
options
listen
man
i'm
high
as
hell
right
now
and
i
need
you
to
tell
me
if
i
shit
my
pants
what
i
need
you
to
tell
me
if
i
shit
my
pants
what
are
you
high
on
weed
damn
you
got
any
more
i
don't
have
time
for
this
did
i
shit
my
pants
or
not
i
do
a
360
spin
nah
man
you
good
you
sure
like
check
my
legs
and
pocket
area
you
look
good
man
i
walked
out
and
made
it
back
to
my
dorm
an
hour
and
a
half
later
this
is
not
criticizing
all
greek
life
two
of
my
best
friends
are
in
a
sorority
and
fraternity
when
i
asked
her
why
she
was
rushing
i
really
like
to
party
and
i
want
to
meet
more
guys
when
i
asked
him
i
tried
other
organizations
but
remembered
what
i
liked
to
do
in
high
school
drink
plus
a
lot
of
my
friends
from
my
hometown
are
wealthy
and
i
already
had
a
frat
wardrobe
so
i
thought
id
fit
in
they
are
both
awesome
people
that
i
love
to
hang
out
with
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
so
damn
embarrassed
that
this
is
truly
what
drew
them
into
greek
life
i
considered
rushing
and
if
i
did
i
would
have
done
it
for
the
sisterhood
philanthropy
and
impact
you
can
leave
on
the
community
instead
i
found
other
cheaper
clubs
to
do
that
in
they
seriously
want
to
dish
out
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
dressed
up
and
plastered
its
so
sad
how
someone
can
have
such
a
superficial
outlook
and
goals
on
their
only
college
experience
do
you
think
they
know
how
fucking
ridiculous
they
sound
so
they
dont
know
each
other
yet
but
now
im
starting
to
think
they
would
be
a
perfect
match
2
halloweens
ago
i
was
dressed
up
as
bane
i
got
fucked
up
and
jacked
a
fire
extinguisher
from
parking
garage
i
carried
it
with
me
behind
northgate
while
i
tried
to
find
transportation
that
would
get
me
home
i
found
one
ugy
candidate
that
wasn't
chained
up
an
old
80
s
era
cycling
bike
this
neglected
dinosaur
was
the
only
bike
out
of
"50,000"
that
wasn't
chained
up
trust
me
i
checked
i
hoped
on
positioned
the
fire
extinguisher
under
arm
and
began
wobbling
down
the
road
as
i
began
going
down
college
main
down
the
hill
away
from
ngate
i
realized
i
had
no
breaks
they
were
cut
n
broken
so
i
was
riding
this
chariot
straight
to
hell
as
i
began
picking
up
speed
there
was
a
lil
bonfire
yard
party
out
front
of
a
house
to
the
left
as
i'm
passing
i
hear
hey
todd
isn't
that
your
bike
i'm
like
nigga
this
ain't
todd's
bike
and
i
continue
thinking
nothing
of
it
well
suddenly
i
realize
a
ninja
is
running
along
the
little
stone
wall
next
to
the
path
and
it's
clear
he
is
on
a
mission
motherfucker
jumps
infront
of
the
bike
and
grabs
on
to
handlebars
and
i
flip
and
all
i
can
think
about
is
a
who
the
fuck
is
todd
b
why
does
he
love
this
bike
soo
much
c.damn
that
fire
extinguisher
makes
a
lot
of
fuckin
racquet
when
it's
launched
from
a
bike
onto
the
pavement
d
is
todd
kenyan
cuz
daaaam
as
i'm
getting
off
the
pavement
a
chubby
girl
in
cat
make
up
is
standing
right
there
whining
and
asking
why
i
took
todd's
bike
i
am
just
flabbergasted
that
garfield
could
cover
40
yards
that
fast
next
thing
i
know
todd's
people
are
surrounding
me
talkin
shit
askin
why
i
took
bike
then
todd
shoves
me
and
says
why'd
u
take
it
at
that
point
i
realize
i
am
going
to
get
gang
raped
by
todd
n
his
cronies
unless
i
can
create
a
diversion
engage
operation
shock
and
awe
i
pickup
extinguisher
and
swing
that
bitch
right
into
side
of
todd's
knee
and
todd
goes
down
ko
bitches
everyone
takes
a
step
back
n
sets
down
the
flames
n
pitch
forks
for
a
second
and
i
shoulder
the
extinguisher
and
say
i'm
just
trying
to
find
hometree
and
book
it
through
the
woods
thus
ends
one
of
the
many
tales
of
the
chupacabra
walked
past
a
tour
group
today
and
overheard
one
mom
ask
is
anyone
who
goes
here
ever
actually
sober
couldn't
help
but
crack
up
because
the
answer
is
more
no
than
yes
i
love
you
unh
4572
when
people
ask
me
why
i
don't
drink
they
throw
out
a
variety
of
options
is
it
a
religious
reason
is
it
a
legal
reason
are
you
uncomfortable
in
those
kinds
of
settings
to
these
people
i'd
like
to
say
did
you
ever
consider
that
maybe
i
value
the
fact
that
my
parents
slaved
away
to
give
me
an
opportunity
that
they
never
could
have
dreamed
of
and
i'm
not
about
to
throw
that
away
for
a
few
nights
of
drunken
fun
you
do
what
you
want
i've
never
asked
you
why
you
drink
so
stop
judging
me
for
my
decision
does
anyone
in
the
lib
have
adderall
3587
we
filled
up
condoms
with
beer
and
threw
them
at
people

you
told
me
not
to
drink
so
much
but
do
you
realize
that
youre
the
reason
i
drink
15684
whenever
i
tell
people
that
i'm
a
chem
major
they
say
oh
like
breaking
bad
my
reply
is
well
my
mom
didn't
approve
of
my
being
an
assassin
so
yes
i
plan
on
doing
a
real
life
re
enactment
of
bb
minus
the
health
problems
for
me
just
told
my
mom
this
now
she
disapproves
of
my
making
meth
since
it
ruins
people's
lives
her
words
bring
back
acid
instead
it
doesn't
rot
people's
teeth
and
it
takes
them
to
a
higher
level
don't
make
meth
like
he
did
break
your
own
bad
i'm
going
to
do
it
i'm
going
to
break
my
own
bad
a
lot
of
people
have
some
pretty
crazy
stories
about
their
wild
nights
at
the
u
who
among
us
hasn't
woken
up
and
gone
where
the
fuck
am
i
and
who
the
fuck
is
that
who
among
us
hasn't
peed
behind
the
bush
next
to
the
entrance
of
the
bars
and
come
onwho
among
us
hasn't
projectile
vomited
across
all
the
bathroom
stalls
in
stoke
hell
i
certainly
know
i
have
but
here's
my
true
confession
that
i
share
with
you
alli
am
a
drunken
kleptomaniac
if
you've
had
something
taken
without
warningit's
likely
sitting
in
my
fucking
room

now
i'm
serious
and
i'm
sorry
but
i
will
be
keeping
them
for
as
long
as

of
these
treasures

a
lovely
collection
of

fine

but
stop
pretending

party
hard
here
when
there's
5
people
out
on
a
saturday
night
cocaine
is
a
stimulant
that
increases
activity
in
the
central
nervous
system
does
that
mean
it's
like
overclocking
your
brain
will
it
improve
my
fps
irl
parties
are
stupid
parties
no
no
thank
you
i'm
not
about
that
crowd
hot
sweaty
drunk
people
grabbing
butts
that
aren't
theirs
to
grab
too
much
alcohol
for
so
many
underage
college
students
the
encouragement
of
getting
laid
by
frat
boys
cramped
spaces
smelling
like
alcohol
and
drugs
disgusting
frat
houses
that
look
like
they
could
double
as
meth
labs
no
no
thank
you
instead
of
dressing
up
or
more
like
dressing
like
a
slut
and
getting
wasted
or
effed
up
and
doing
things
you're
going
to
regret
and
most
likely
not
remember
tomorrow
i'd
rather
have
a
girls
night
in
with
my
best
guy
friends
nothing
like
food
movies
and
more
food
college
is
what
you

get
an
education

thanks
and
gig
em

a
freshman

the
easiest
way
to
get
alcohol
if
you're
under
aged
and
are
not
good
friends
with
many
people
who
are
21

where

best
parties
on
campus
like
how
would
i

about
getting
into
frat
parties
and

question
like
i'm
an
aerospace
engineer
major
who
was
in
top
5
of
her
class
of
1000
so
i'm
not
gonna

i'm
not
a
stupid
person

of
the
same
old
routine
and
kinda
just
need
to
get
drunk

can
the
people
staying
in
ithaca
over
spring
break
choose
a
bar
that
we
will
all
go
to
and
party
at
post
your
preference
6069
met
a
cute
guy
at
a
party
last
weekend
i
think
you
were
a
flute
but
i
didn't
really
get
to
talk
to
you
and
i
was
high
as
f
lol
anyway
hit
me
up
2587
i
have
no
problem
with
the
presence
of
alcohol
and
i
drink
at
parties
but
sometimes
it
feels
like
alcohol
is
the
event
for
a
lot
of
people
i'm
not
saying
anybody
should
give
up
drinking
if
they
enjoy
it
but
the
the
first
thing
you
ask
your
friend
when
they
invite
you
somewhere
on
a
saturday
night
shouldn't
be
is
there
going
to
be
enough
beer
89
it
really
bothers
me
that
nobody
looks
each
other
in
the
eye
when
they
walk
around
campus
i
took
a
little
bit
too
much
lsd
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
started
wandering
around
campus
by
myself
it
made
me
really
sad
that
nobody
was
willing
to
look
me
in
the
eye
and
smile
isn't
anybody
happy
to
be
going
here
what's
your
opinion
on
the
best
beer
to
ring
dunk
with
14515
i
no
nothing
of
economics
or
government
policies
so
my
opinions
may
be
in
the
wrong
here
but
what
i
hate
about
some
of
my
friends
are
their
arguments
for
the
following
people
say
that
drugs
should
be
legalized
and
taxed
heavily
in
order
to
curb
their
sales
in
the
u.s
and
other
sovereign
nations
what
i
don't
understand
is
wouldn't
this
just
force
drug
dealers
to
go
ahead
and
continue
their
sale
of
products
on
the
black
market
at
independent
prices
with
disregard
to
government
tariffs
so
now
you
have
a
situation
where
drugs
are
still
being
sold
but
it
is
harder
for
police
to
apprehend
dealers
since
the
substance
they
have
on
their
body
is
now
legal
also
when
friends
of
mine
by
weed
don't
they
realize
where
this
shit
comes
from
their
demand
for
this
product
is
basically
fueling
a
system
where
their
money
is
trickling
down
to
those
colombian
and
columbian
drug
bastard
mob
bosses
who
ruin
children's
lives
if
you
really
want
to
smoke
this
shit
then
you
should
ball
up
and
grow
it
yourself
i
personally
smoke
plastics
also
i
also
like
you
14496
love
shoving
a
colorful
assortment
of
vegetables
up
my
anus
and
pretending
i
have
a
cool
tail
you
seem
fun
we
should
meet
up
some
time
i
missed
4
20
on
4
20
sigh
i
guess
i'll
never
know
the
feeling
of
just
blazing
there's
always
next
year
right
14790
i'm
not
the
type
of
guy
who's
superstitious
or
religious
but
i
swear
that
my
house
is
haunted
for
the
summer
i'm
living
alone
in
this
rickety
old
house
at
night
when
i'm
about
to
go
to
sleep
i
keep
hearing
sounds
like
someone
is
walking
around
i
always
go
and
check
the
rooms
but
no
one's
there
ever
occasionally
i
even
hear
some
mumbling
or
moans
like
someone
is
trying
to
get
my
attention
twice
i've
felt
someone
tug
at
my
clothes
when
i
entered
the
bathroom
a
couple
of
times
my
phone's
gone
missing
and
i've
always
found
it
in
the
same
spot
in
the
bathroom
near
the
toilet
wtf
and
last
tuesday
when
i
went
to
sleep
i
felt
like
something
was
in
the
bed
beside
me
sleeping
alongside
me
so
to
remedy
all
of
this
i've
started
smoking
copious
amounts
of
weed
and
consuming
unhealthy
amounts
of
alcohol
now
if
i
feel
something
hear
something
or
see
something
i
just
start
laughing
and
throwing
shit
at
it
pulling
out
my
dick
and
pissing
all
over
the
floor
i
scream
f
ck
the
world
and
go
to
sleep
with
no
regrets
at
all
4792
why
is
drinking
a
braggard
right
lets
see
who
can
drink
more
totally
awesome
not
especially
because
we
may
be
friends
tonight
but
i
won't
remember
you
in
the
morning
does
everyone
know
that
smokers
are
also
aware
of
the
health
effects
of
smoking
cause
it's
really
fucking
annoying
to
be
constantly
berrated
and
nagged
at
sometimes
by
total
strangers
on
this
campus
at
least
for
a
personal
choice
most
of
us
recognize
it's
a
shitty
choice
we
are
making
for
now
anyway
if
i'm
smoking
outside
and
i
don't
know
you
back
the
fuck
off
3535
am
i
the
only
one
that
is
annoyed
by
the
thirst
that
is
north
campus
those
freshmen
and
their
constant
need
for
sex
drugs
and
alcohol
is
unsettling
to
say
the
least
how
about
you
read
a
book
and
work
on
the
grades
huh
drinko
de
mayo
aftermath
went
home
this
morning
and
my
mom
keeps
asking
me
what's
wrong
and
if
i'm
okay
does
she
not
understand
that
i
am
hungover
i've
become
so
drugged
up
on
anti
depressants
alcohol
and
recreational
drugs
that
i've
reached
a
point
where
apathy
is
my
only
state
of
mind
i
can
no
longer
find
excitement
and
joy
from
fun
activities
or
sadness
or
the
ability
to
care
for
my
failures
my
friends
don't
see
it
and
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
tell
them
at
that
what
could
they
do
i
drink
every
weekend
and
have
a
great
time
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
help
a
newly
21
year
old
out
where's
the
cheapest
place
to
buy
beer
on
campus
840
come
on
guys
we're
smarter
than
this
let's
drop
the
hate
and
get
down
to
what
really
matters
who's
rolling
their
asses
off
at
the
spring
concert
during
the
past
year
have
you
consumed
alcohol
i.e
had
more
than
a
few
sips
of
beer
wine
or
liquor
guessing
the
alcohol
edu
creator
was
not
a
badger
am
i
an
evil
vicious
person
because
i
am
so
weak
that
drugs
have
become
more
vital
than
water
for
me
to
the
point
that
when
i
moved
into
a
room
my
best
friend
2
previous
roommates
had
available
that
i
know
i
have
casted
a
presence
in
which
drug
use
is
so
acceptable
by
mere
justification
i
had
to
bring
drugs
with
me
because
i
have
become
so
socially
dependent
on
them
the
thought
of
meeting
their
other
3
roommates
and
getting
people
to
like
me
was
so
terrifying
well
i
shared
some
with
my
best
friend
when
we
went
out
on
the
first
night
and
after
becoming
intoxicated
i
mentioned
i
had
them
to
one
other
roommate
out
with
us
whom
i
just
met
he
was
down
to
do
them
i
believe
it
was
his
4
time
with
this
particular
substance
ever
and
he
had
never
purchased
it
well
it
was
no
secret
i
was
a
daily
user
but
what
kills
me
is
he
went
from
4
total
to
3rd
time
this
week
and
he
purchased
them
from
my
personal
he
asked
for
more
tonight
and
i
told
him
i
was
out
it
is
barely
thursday
my
influence
had
him
and
a
couple
other
roommates
following
my
unintentional
influence
an
occasional
weekend
is
one
thing
damn
even
every
weekend
isn't
that
bad
but
tuesday
wed
and
thurs
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
use
for
no
reason
at
all
and
they
were
so
quick
because
i
have
given
them
an
impression
that
it
is
the
cool
thing
to
do
i
see
it
when
they
ask
me
questions
or
they
help
me
find
something
or
i
tell
them
a
story
they
don't
see
it
for
how
pathetic
it
is
they
see
it
as
if
i'm
some
sort
of
big
shot
because
i
will
offer
their
friends
more
and
more
money
for
their
scripts
until
they
can't
say
no
because
my
tolerance
is
so
high
for
everything
that
i
take
that
it's
almost
at
a
point
they
can
brag
to
people
about
it
like
if
they
were
bragging
that
i
was
the
best
at
a
certain
skill
or
sport
this
isn't
the
life
i
chose
this
isn't
how
i
wanted
things
to
be
for
me
i
want
to
spend
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
dollars
on
things
i
can
show
for
myself
or
to
better
someone
this
life
is
not
cool
if
i
could
take
it
all
back
i
would
never
have
tried
one
thing
ever
you
will
never
realize
how
quickly
and
strong
it
takes
over
and
things
will
never
be
the
same
i
was
blessed
with
a
life
that
i
can
only
describe
as
privileged
i
had
everything
and
more
i
had
the
amazing
car
best
phone
best
laptop
an
amazing
girl
i
would
travel
the
country
yearly
i
was
in
the
best
school
in
the
world
and
i
could
spend
money
on
anything
i
desired
i
never
knew
how
it
felt
to
be
broke
and
hungry
it
all
started
one
week
day
when
my
ex
roommate
made
me
feel
that
it
was
cool
to
take
pills
for
no
reason
and
to
find
joy
in
them
my
use
is
apparent
there
is
no
changing
that
whether
they
think
i
have
a
problem
or
if
i
do
it
for
fun
they
are
aware
it
is
a
daily
constant
thing
so
i
can't
hide
it
from
them
but
i
just
don't
want
them
to
use
my
actions
as
justification
or
as
a
gateway
do
you
think
i
am
horrible
lol
at
the
girl
and
guy
that
got
mips
for
drinking
in
your
car
at
harry's
how
did
you
two
get
into
a
m
in
the
first
place
re
does
anyone
in
the
lib
have
adderall
i'll
be
in
the
1st
floor
map
room
at
9pm
915
during
the
fall
quarter
one
night
i
had
been
drinking
with
some
of
my
friends
particularly
because
this
girl
i
was
dating
wanted
to
see
me
drink
i
passed
out
on
her
couch
woke
up
a
little
after
6
am
and
walked
home
my
roommate's
girlfriend
was
up
at
7
as
she
always
is
getting
ready
for
work
when
she
saw
me
she
asked
if
i
had
just
gotten
home
yeah
i
just
walked
home
where
are
your
pants
i
feel
especially
stupid
because
before
i
left
my
friend's
place
i
consciously
thought
you're
going
back
to
your
place
you
need
your
keys
and
unclipped
my
keys
from
my
pants
which
were
on
the
floor
but
forgot
my
pants
and
not
once
did
i
stop
during
my
walk
to
think
about
how
cold
it
was

am
a
typical
lafayette
student
and
drink
like
one

hope

don't

alcoholic

of
college

4
years
of
continuous
drinking

why

it
hard
to
find
coke
at
this
school
all
i
want
for
my
last
semester
is
a
steady
connect
and
a
friend
who
loves
to
put
things
up
his
her
nose
i
don't
discriminate
officer
how
high
are
you

are
you
2277
why
is
it
so
hard
to
find
a
man
to
smoke
weed
with
bro
out
with
and
have
sex
with
on
a
regular
basis
i
know
cornell
is
stressing
you
boys
out
too
so
why
not
help
each
other
blow
some
steam
off
and
unwind
so
i
dont
understand
going
to
northgate
and
pay
ridiculous
amount
of
money
just
to
get
some
drink
when
you
can
just
drink
at
your
apartment
with
friends
what
is
the
difference
i
dont
get
how
fun
it
can
be
are
we
all
paying
much
amount
of
money
just
to
tell
others
that
we
are
having
a
good
time
or
staring
at
attractive
people
that
might
appear
every
40minute
also
i
do
not
understand
going
dancing
what
do
guys
do
beside
standing
there
like
an
idiot
and
creepy
or
make
a
fool
out
of
himself
yeah
you
white
boys
all
of
yall
dancing
like
a
squid

i'm
having
the
most
drunk
existentialist
moment
on
42nd
and
6th
right
now
i'm
sitting
here
watching
people
pass
me
by
and
i'm
wondering
what
i'm
doing
with
my
life
where
am
i
suppose
to
go
who
or
what
am
i
waiting
for
someone
come
find
me
i
feel
like
i
should
get
my
adderall
dealer
a
christmas
present
for
helping
me
get
good
grades
in
school
2593
where
are
the
lady
stoners
of
georgetown

you're
out
there

let's
stop
smoking
directly
in
front
of
the
no
smoking
signs
shall
we
you're
at
cornell

can
read
the
sign

in
high
school
i
was
so
uptight
and
goody
goody
i
put
homework
before
everything
cringed
at
the
thought
of
ever
drinking
or
smoking
and
my
ipod
consisted
solely
of
christian
rock
now
i
only
feel
the
need
to
do
the
bare
minimum
to
pass
my
classes
love
drinking
and
occasionally
smoking
weed
on
the
weekends
and
enjoy
listening
to
hardcore
rap
and
old
school
hip
hop
when
i
wanna
relax
what's
happening
to
meeeee
i
have
horrible
headaches
almost
everyday
all
day
i
don't
want
to
take
big
scary
pills
because
of
personal
beliefs
i
researched
the
medical
use
of
marijuana
and
there
are
only
very
poor
quality
research
done
on
the
subject
what's
the
deal
with
this
shit
i
just
want
relief
from
headaches
in
a
more
natural
way
than
pills
i
just
don't
get
what
our
federal
government
has
against
marijuana
