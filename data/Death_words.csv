one
time
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
class
and
the
final
was
to
kill
yourself
or
you
fail
out
of
cornell
how
many
perfectionists
would
choose
one
or
the
other
and
then
i
thought
of
our
suicide
history
and
put
myself
in
time
out
real
talk
regarding
the
whole
fish
camp
photos
people
make
mistakes
it
was
clearly
a
mistake
i
am
quite
positive
the
camp
was
not
intending
to
be
disrespectful
who
would
do
that
i
am
looking
at
everyone's
post
only
to
find
a
bunch
of
rude
comments
condemning
fish
camp
everyone's
acting
as
if
they
have
never
made
a
mistake
as
if
they
are
a
perfect
aggie
you
aren't
neither
am
i
i
see
things
like
they
should
apologize
they
are
terrible
what
a
horrible
organization
duh
they
should
apologize
and
they
are
it
was
a
camp
of
20
something
counselors
out
of
1000
some
odd
people
why
would
we
want
to
take
the
whole
dang
organization
down
fish
camp
does
alot
of
great
things
when
i
went
i
really
received
a
fire
of
aggie
spirit
from
the
experience
i
also
learned
about
my
school
and
its
amazing
traditions
i
wasn't
even
one
if
the
people
all
into
it
please
stop
with
the
rude
remarks
it
just
makes
the
fire
bigger
it
doesn't
solve
anything
it
makes
it
a
heck
of
alot
worse
i've
seen
so
many
mean
comments
about
people
and
the
organization
if
you
have
nothing
nice
to
say
then
don't
say
it
nobody
is
perfect
ever
we
got
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
help
eachother
along
the
way
one
of
the
core
values
is
respect
we
have
to
respect
eachother
as
well
the
day
the
bombing
in
boston
occurred
i
felt
not
for
the
families
but
intense
rage
towards
those
who
had
done
it
i
took
complete
satisfaction
in
knowing
their
was
an
unstoppable
chain
of
events
we
would
never
know
about
which
would
end
in
those
people's
demise
does
that
make
me
insensitive
suicide
is
a
crime
in
some
places
on
earth
always
wondered
why
so
let's
play
a
game
i'm
going
to
kill
myself
can
you
guess
which
dorm
room
is
mine
3095
i
didn't
go
to
my
father's
funeral
he
was
never
there
for
me
so
why
should
i
be
there
for
him
i
cried
when
i
found
out
about
cory
monteith's
finn
hudson
from
glee
death
i
always
watched
glee
and
connected
with
his
character
because
of
his
similar
struggles
i
couldn't
believe
it
when
it
happened
he
honestly
felt
like
a
really
close
friend
to
me
as
a
21
year
old
guy
watching
glee
was
an
outlet
for
me
no
i'm
not
a
closet
homosexual
i'm
just
a
normal
guy
that
loves
practically
every
sport
but
can't
love
musicals
acting
singing
etc
to
all
my
fellow
gleeks
don't
stop
believing
my
dog
died
this
winterbreak
he
was
a
7
year
old
beagle
my
neighbors
recently
got
a
german
shepard
and
the
dog
would
constantly
start
shit
with
my
dog
it
would
bark
and
my
dog
would
howl
back
and
my
neighbors
would
always
complain
to
us
about
it
a
week
and
a
half
ago
their
dog
jumped
over
the
wall
and
killed
my
dog
i
saw
it
all
happen
and
their
was
nothing
i
could
about
it
that
was
the
worst
part
i
went
and
yelled
at
the
neighbors
and
they
had
the
nerve
to
say
my
dog
instigated
the
fight
and
claiming
that
their
dog
wouldn't
hurt
a
fly
i
was
pissed
we
live
near
a
wooded
area
and
i
told
my
parents
a
wild
animal
must
have
attacked
him
i
didn't
report
it
i
wanted
to
deal
with
this
myself
a
few
days
ago
i
watched
their
house
and
waited
for
them
to
leave
once
they
left
i
made
sure
by
ringing
their
doorbell
several
times
and
not
being
answered
i
injected
a
large
amount
of
rat
poison
into
some
meat
and
fed
it
to
their
dog
i
did
this
every
twenty
minutes
with
different
pieces
of
meat
for
two
hours
and
their
dog
ate
it
up
i
watched
as
their
dog
became
sick
i
watched
as
the
family
did
all
they
could
to
save
it
i
watched
as
their
kids
cried
and
their
parents
grew
upset
i
watched
as
they
buried
their
dog
in
their
backyard
with
a
little
cross
on
it
and
you
know
what
it
felt
good
it
was
exhilarating
watching
the
hope
fade
from
their
faces
and
it
was
even
more
gratifying
seeing
that
dog
suffer
and
vomit
profusely
even
typing
this
i
start
to
feel
a
rush
of
excitement
i
got
revenge
and
it
felt
fantastic
r.i.p
otis
back
to
that
death
penalty
confession
room
that
was
essentially
a
giant
blocked
in
treadmill
made
of
sandpaper
i
see
people
all
the
time
on
this
page
saying
rapists
need
the
death
penalty
most
people
who
say
this
when
you
talk
to
them
1
on
1
say
that
the
death
penalty
in
general
is
bad
contradictory
logic
anyways
the
best
way
to
do
the
death
penalty
would
be
hire
a
serial
killer
already
on
death
row
to
carry
out
another's
execution
in
a
normal
way
such
as
hanging
that
way
normal
people
guards
don't
get
ptsd
or
whatever
in
return
the
killer
gets
a
1
week
stay
on
his
execution
great
plan
amirite
my
grandpa
was
a
die
hard
st
louis
cardinals
fan
he's
from
wisconsin
but
growing
up
on
the
farm
the
cardinals
games
were
the
only
one
his
radio
would
pick
up
he
suffered
with
several
ailments
for
many
years
including
parkinson
disease
and
died
when
i
was
in
middle
school
as
soon
as
he
did
a
family
of
cardinals
moved
into
my
grandma's
back
yard
coincidence
here
on
campus
i
volunteer
at
a
lab
researching
the
affects
of
parkinsons
today
after
having
spent
all
afternoon
finishing
up
a
project
for
the
lab
i
saw
a
beautiful
bright
red
cardinal
perched
in
a
tree
outside
vanhise
as
soon
as
i
left
msc
i
think
someone
is
likes
what
his
granddaughter
is
up
to
here
at
uw
madison
just
one
of
the
many
miracles
here
on
campus
the
complex
manager
at
the
woodlands
has
had
at
least
six
people
in
her
immediate
family
die
in
the
last
eight
months
and
missed
a
full
week
or
more
of
work
every
time
where
the
heck
do
i
find
a
job
where
i
can
take
off
six
weeks
a
year
without
prior
notice
and
still
be
employed
admin
edit
if
you're
being
snide
and
suggesting
that
her
requests
have
been
fraudulent
then
so
be
it
and
what
not
but
if
you're
saying
this
and
you
know
her
requests
have
been
valid
then
you're
just
being
an
ass
commenting
on
how
much
time
can
be
taken
vs
employment
but
if
you're
serious
read
up.it's
called
bereavement
leave
and
trust
me
you
don't
want
to
have
to
take
it
it
varies
between
company
employer
and
individual
boss
on
how
this
gets
approved
i've
known
an
engineer
who
had
to
miss
work
for
an
entire
year
had
to
go
overseas
after
the
loss
get
things
sorted
out
and
squared
away
in
europe
and
came
back
to
continue
his
duties
here
pay
stops
after
the
end
of
the
formal
bereavement
leave
allotment
but
then
it
can
be
taken
as
unpaid
leave
i
had
a
company
offer
me
3
months
bereavement
and
unpaid
leave
for
a
single
incident
it
all
depends
on
how
much
you're
worth
to
them
your
position
and
length
of
service
and
nature
of
the
situation
why
is
it
that
thirteen
embassy
attacks
happened
under
gwb
costing
us
dozens
of
lives
and
republicans
didn't
give
two
shits
but
an
incident
happens
in
benghazi
costing
us
four
lives
and
they
are
ready
to
impeach
the
president
over
it
and
let's
not
even
talk
about
how
the
iraq
war
which
was
based
on
a
lie
cost
us
"4,000"
lives
and
who
knows
how
many
innocent
iraqi
civilians
i
don't
agree
with
liberals
on
everything
hell
i
was
willing
to
vote
for
rubio
over
clinton
in
2016
but
the
republicans
have
become
such
slimy
hypocrites
and
they
have
gone
so
far
right
that
i
can't
even
stomach
the
thought
of
voting
for
them
anymore
and
to
the
genius
who
said
that
democrats
favor
unrestricted
welfare
and
that's
why
they
get
votes
it
was
actually
bill
clinton
who
passed
welfare
reform
which
drastically
limited
the
size
and
scope
of
the
benefits
people
could
receive
now
about
4
of
the
population
is
on
welfare
whereas
52
of
the
population
voted
democrat
in
the
last
election
people
don't
vote
democrat
because
they
are
getting
government
goods
they
vote
democrat
because
too
many
republicans
are
uninformed
extremists
prayers
for
the
families
affected
by
the

who's
bright
idea
was
it
to
disarm
military
personnel
on
their
own
bases
admin
edit
these
are
tough
times
and
depressing
as
can
be
for
everyone
thoughts
and
prayers
go
a
long
way
as
does
being
there
to
help
anyone
affected
to
the
point
about
the
disarming
however
that
isn't
as
cut
and
dry
to
place
blame
on
any
one
entity
not
entirely
in
the
true
historical
context
at
least
for
our
army
this
originated
with
a
dod
directive
in
1992
over
the
years
the
other
branches
picked
up
similar
initiatives
that
range
from
installation
to
installation
and
the
nature
of
each
one
you
can
look
this
up
on
your
own
but
a
quick
trip
down
history
lane
and
you'll
see
that
this
has
been
a
policy
for
various
military
forces
around
the
world
for
ages
even
as
far
back
as
ancient
greece
where
athenian
hoplites
would
store
their
weaponry
within
the
armory
or
standing
roman
armies
were
not
permitted
within
the
inner
gates
of
rome
if
nothing
else
the
movie
gladiator
made
a
brief
remark
on
this
to
even
arms
being
stored
in
the
castle
armories
in
the
medieval
era
just
the
scale
and
application
of
this
practice
has
varied
over
the
years
1016
the
police
trucks
that
load
up
all
the
drunken
people
remind
me
of
something
out
of
a
horror
movie
where
do
they
take
them
it's
like
a
transport
system
to
an
inevitable
death
in
a
gas
chamber
this
morning
when
i
walked
into
my
german
class
my
heart
was
heavy
with
the
memory
of
the
tragic
events
that
occurred
on
this
day
one
of
my
classmates
asked
how
my
day
was
going
and
i
responded
that
i
was
very
sad
when
he
asked
why
i
reminded
him
that
today
is
september
11th
a
day
that
is
universally
mourned
by
our
country
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
took
in
my
words
before
looking
out
the
window
at
the
sunshine
and
responding
simply
yeah
but
today
can
still
be
a
good
day
and
you
know
what
he's
right
thank
you
for
reminding
me
that
even
though
we
still
grieve
those
who
were
lost
the
darkness
doesn't
last
forever
