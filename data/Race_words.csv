i
wanted
to
visit
the
lgbt
resource
center
to
see
if
i
could
meet
a
guy
there
but
i
feel
like
it
is
an
inappropriate
use
of
the
resource
am
i
wrong
what
advice
would
you
give
is
there
a
rastafari
group
here
at
a
m
i'm
jamaican
but
i
haven't
found
another
jamaican
yet
i'm
a
self
proclaimed
atheist
yet
when
it
comes
to
my
loved
ones

a
higher
being
to
a
non
particular
god

you
will

does
that
make
me
so
were
can
i
meet
latina
women

here
in
palestine
that
moment
when

there
are
black
guys
with
their
ghetto
cars
parked
right
next
to
you
but
they
are
inside

staring
at
you
in
1am

at
2am

other
side
of
your
car
and
doing
the
same
shit
i
am
worried
about

am
kind
of
racist
but

i
wish

time
to

park
next
to
me

def
not
my
neighbors
lol
5278
those
damn
feminists
maybe
women
had
a
choice
for
a
little
while
but
now
it's
just
a
standard
if
i
wasn't
expected
to
be
the
best
i
wouldn't
be
a
girl
busting
my
ass
in
engineering
right
now
i'd
be
sewing
pretty
little
girls
dresses
and
making
sure
dinner
is
ready
when
my
man
gets
home
would
that
really
be
so
bad
15210
i'm
a
black
guy
who
can't
get
white
women
what
am
i
doing
wrong
how
do
you
asian
women
feel
about
dating
indian
guys
because
i
do
not
like
indian
women
for
i've
been
around
them
too
much
not
that
you're
bad
looking
or
anything
but
i
am
single
and
ready
to
mingle
in
the
asian
market
i
need
to
find
a
christian
group
so
that
i
can
grow
in
my
faith
anyone
have
any
pointers
p.s
hot
guys
are
a
definite
plus
on
behalf
of
all
men
i
want
to
make
a
sincere
apology
to
all
women
who
have
been
neglected
abused
mistreated
cheated
and
disrespected
in
relationships
also
i
am
speaking
to
the
women
who
just
can't
seem
to
find
the
right
guy
i
have
been
speaking
with
women
who
are
in
these
relationships
so
i
dedicate
this
to
you
all
for
being
so
strong
when
you
don't
even
know
that
you
are
relationships
should
be
a
comfort
zone
not
where
you
feel
uneasy
so
please
accept
this
apology
and
know
that
things
will
get
better

im
mixed
hispanic
and
white
and
95
of
the
time
i
get
hit
on
by
guys
its
because
they
say
i
have
a
nice
black
girl
ass
and
it
is
black
guys
that
hit
on
me
i
have
only
dated
black
guys
just
because
they
are
the
only
ones
who
have
ever
shown
interest
is
a
size
7
considered
fat
i
feel
that
my
size
is
whats
turning
off
guys
that
or
maybe
i'm
just
ugly
to
the
person
who
said
white
people
can't
say
the
n
word
okay
so
i'm
going
to
rant
about
this
a
little
bit
i
went
to
a
black
predominant
school
in
elementary
and
high
school
and
you
know
what
i
hate
it
when
black
people
say
the
n
word
why
because
if
a
black
person
says
it
why
not
a
white
guy
i'm
asian
and
you
don't
see
us
saying
oh
hey
chink
or
other
races
call
themselves
what
ever
negative
race
word
implies
to
them
its
stupid
so
your
confession
should
really
be
hey
black
friends
maybe
if
we
stop
using
the
n
word
then
other
people
will
stop
using
it
to
d
the
jokes
on
you
on
a
side
note
gold
all
in
my
chain
don't
believe
just
watch
13092
in
response
to
13080
who's
arguing
against
the
statistics
about
frat
culture
being
rape
culture
you
claim
that
rape
only
occurs
in
the
greek
system
because
there
are
more
parties
in
the
greek
system
so
the
greek
culture
leads
to
more
parties
and
more
parties
leads
to
more
rape
so
isn't
that
saying
that
the
greek
culture
is
in
fact
conducive
to
rape
culture
you
dismiss
the
problem
by
claiming
that
those
horrifying
statistics
come
about
just
because
these
are
the
people
that
are
generally
in
situations
where
things
can
go
wrong
that's
the
problem
though
the
greek
system
should
be
actively
taking
steps
to
ensure
that
there
are
no
such
situations
where
things
can
go
wrong
you
can
still
party
obviously
but
drinking
to
the
point
of
making
these
dumb
decisions
and
creating
a
culture
where
objectifying
women
is
even
considered
acceptable
public
behavior
see
the
jugs
fundraiser
is
not
necessary
and
needs
to
change
now
the
problem
is
not
partying
itself
you
can
party
without
raping
people
i
would
love
to
see
a
greek
leader
coming
forward
publicly
and
take
actual
steps
to
mitigate
this
problem
instead
of
brushing
it
under
the
bed
saying
it's
not
us
the
party
made
us
do
it
true
not
all
greeks
buy
into
this
dangerous
culture
but
some
do
and
that's
the
problem
are
there
any
tips
for
asian
right
the
pale
ones
males
to
impress
american
females
get
ripped
drive
a
lexus
suggestion
needed
really
thanks

any
interracial
couples
down
here
i'm
white
and
my
boyfriend
is
mexican
and
i
feel
like

the
only
ones

i've
been
wondering
i'm
a
hispanic
girl
and
i
think
i'm
a
pretty
good
looking
girl
by
no
means
being
cocky
promise
guys
how
do
white
guys
feels
about
latinas
coming
to
a
m
where
most
guys
are
white
and
feeling
like
they
are
not
into
me
makes
me
feel
like
the
odds
of
finding
a
husband
will
be
slim
specially
with
the
corp
i
guess
i'm
a
bit
of
a
boot
chaser
what
can
i
do
i
have
a
black
room
mate
is
it
a
usual
thing
for
black
people
to
have
a
strong
smell
4399
it's
not
even
about
our
genders
our
ages
what
is
sexual
orientation
but
an
invisible
fence
around
love
what
is
age
but
an
often
inaccurate
gauge
of
maturity
all
i
know
is
that
i'm
drawn
to
you
and
your
person
and
my
heart
beats
for
your
smile
you
know
kind
of
like
the
way
it
used
to
beat
for
his
except
now
i
am
neither
seventeen
nor
naive
now
i'm
just
jaded
walls
built
higher
but
even
jericho
fell
at
the
sound
of
the
right
voice
to
the
person
who
works
in
the
mall
posting
about
the
american
indian
what
store
do
you
work
at
and
what
time
does
he
pass
through
or
to
the
girl
confirming
this
guy
is
an
indian
how
can
i
get
in
touch
with
him
i
would
love
to
bump
into
him
and
meet
him
then
have
him
bump
into
my
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
really
do
not
care
much
what
he
actually
looks
like
just
that
he
is
an
indian
you
could
say
i
am
a
conosur
of
cock
and
i
have
tried
to
fuck
at
least
one
guy
of
every
race
and
have
yet
to
actually

an
american
indian

why
are
rice
guys
so
cute
especially
the
asian
ones
honestly
a
little
upset
about
the
amount
of
gilrs
wearing
burkas
on
campus
i
know
its
for
religious
reasons
but
this
isn't
saudi
arabia
or
some
other
middle
eastern
hell
hole
they
shouldn't
have
to
wear
that
france
banned
burkas
how
the
hell
are
we
less
conservative
than
france
ok
so
i
ride
bus
26
on
a
regular
basis
i've
noticed
this
a
lot
and
i
don't
mean
to
sound
racist
by
asking
this
but
why
are
there
so
many
asians
that
ride
it
it's
even
weirder
when
i
stay
on
campus
late
and
there
are
more
asians
riding
the
11
15
pm
bus
than
at
any
other
point
of
the
day
about
90
of
that
bus
is
asians
at
that
time
and
at
no
matter
what
time
of
day
they
usually
all
get
off
at
the
spot
i
gotta
ask
but
is
there
a
reason
for
this
do
they
all
work
in
the
same
major
area
whatever
is
there
some
secret
community
for
only
asians
i
need
answers
people
15477
so
i
don't
know
how
many
are
trolls
but
there
are
a
lot
of
posts
about
wanting
to
bag
a
black
guy
i'm
not
sure
whether
to
feel
respected
or
insulted
that
no
one
on
this
board
and
seemingly
on
campus
is
desirous
of
black
women
can
we
get
some
love
lust
cordially
objectify
please
4278
i
legitimately
don't
understand
why
there
is
a
debate
over
diversity
right
now
nyu
is
more
diverse
than
many
other
universities
and
quite
frankly
i
think
that
being
accepted
to
this
institution
has
more
to
do
with
qualifications
than
ethnic
background
if
you
are
so
concerned
about
the
diversity
of
nyu
and
it
bothers
you
that
much
then
you
probably
should
have
gone
to
a
different
university
and
furthermore
why
are
we
making
race
into
such
a
large
issue
we
are
all
people
and
it
shouldn't
matter
what
someone's
skin
color
is
seriously
i
don't
understand
you
chose
to
come
here
either
stop
complaining
or
transfer
i
cringe
whenever
a
woman
says
she
doesn't
like
feminists
or
she
thinks
they're
annoying
etc
why
would
anyone
particularly
a
woman
not
be
a
feminist
do
you
not
want
to
be
equal
a
lot
of
you
obviously
do
not
know
what
feminism
is
read
a
damn
book
and
stop
making
us
as
a
gender
look
dumb
1618
i
am
really
attracted
to
a
girl
who
is
a
different
race
than
me
i
don't
care
about
race
but
then
again
what
if
she
does
i
feel
like
i
don't
see
enough
interracial
couples
around
campus
what
does
a
chocolate
female
have
to
do
to
get
some
vanilla
around
here
4761
food
for
thought
why
do
women
fight
for
equality
and
yet
in
the
same
breath
deem
themselves
victims
if
irresponsible
sex
happens
after
a
night
of
drunken
partying
i
confess
that
i
think
this
is
bullshit
are
they
not
equally
drunk
were
they
forced
to
get
shit
faced
no
some
of
them
not
all
made
poor
decisions
under
clouded
judgement
and
regretted
it
so
girls
of
georgetown
remember
this
your
regrets
can
cost
someone
their
freedom
their
reputation
if
you
don't
care
and
think
yourself
completely
free
from
accountability
then
you
are
just
as
much
of
a
monster
so
do
white
guys
really
prefer
asian
girls
15350
why
do
all
black
girls
do
their
hair
like
that
vaginas
are
supposedly
self
cleaning
organs
right
so
isn't
that
just
proof
that
women
were
designed
to
clean
intelligentdesign
godswill
natureknowswhatsup
i
attract
the
wrong
kinds
of
guys
ugh
where
are
the
white
single
non
drug
user
guys
ugh
aggravated
white
girl
2187
co
worker
it's
disgusting
how
much
it's
expanding
it's
like
nyu
is
making
it
its
business
to
spread
all
that
homosexuality
don't
they
realize
the
repercussions
me
yeah
your
son's
boyfriend
also
realizes
the
repercussions
i
had
a
class
with
him
last
semester
are
there
any
other
guys
here
who
life
black
girls
but
don't
know
how
to
go
about
it
any
tips
on
how
to
get
with
one
i
believe
the
internet
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
people
are
turning
away
from
religion
the
way
it
connects
the
world
and
shares
information
with
a
click
of
a
button
is
awesome
but
when
some
atheist
busts
out
a
logically
sound
argument
how
there
is
no
god
it
makes
weak
minded
12
year
olds
who
spend
their
whole
days
on
computers
question
their
beliefs
if
they
had
any
in
the
first
place
then
they
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
preaching
what
they
believe
converting
people
to
what
they
see
as
the
truth
and
i
know
not
all
atheists
do
this
and
i
know
that
this
is
the
whole
basis
of
christianity
but
why
shove
what
you
think
is
right
down
people's
throats
hell
i'll
admit
i've
questioned
my
faith
a
couple
of
times
due
to
a
logically
sound
statement
that
i've
seen
on
the
internet
before
i
even
believe
in
evolution
and
the
big
bang
it
just
makes
sense
but
the
fact
remains
is
that
life
is
beautiful
and
the
way
the
universe
functions
in
such
harmony
i
truly
believe
there
has
to
be
a
higher
power
force
of
nature
that
enabled
me
to
do
this
call
him
her
it
god
or
whatever
you
choose
i
think
we
can
all
agree
on
that
when
i
finished
typing
this
i
realized
i
strayed
completely
off
topic
my
bad
tl
dr
i
believe
the
internet
is
making
people
turn
away
from
religion
and
this
upsets
me
but
then
again
it
doesn't
my
theory
is
that
women
can
only
pair
bond
to
one
male
at
a
time
and
that
is
what
makes
them
seem
like
a
good
woman
or
basically
its
the
pair
bond
that
causes
her
to
engage
in
a
heightened
display
of
positive
qualities
she
does
not
show
to
others
once
she
has
sex
with
another
male
she
begins
to
release
oxytocin
and
associate
it
with
him
and
thus
starts
to
form
a
bond
with
this
other
man
compound
this
with
the
problem
she
is
no
longer
associating
oxytocin
releases
with
her
husband
as
they're
no
longer
having
sex
and
you
have
a
woman
who
is
no
longer
pair
bonded
or
in
love
with
her
husband
but
has
indeed
checked
out
and
is
now
bonding
with
a
completely
different
man
despite
for
all
appearances
being
married
to
her
soon
to
be
ex
once
they
branch
swing
or
have
already
undergone
lengthy
preparations
to
ensure
the
branch
swing
is
successful
as
it
appears
this
woman
is
doing
the
pair
bond
is
broken
in
fact
the
pair
bond
is
long
broken
before
she
actually
commits
to
the
branch
swing
the
pair
bond
was
destroyed
the
very
moment
she
started
enjoying
regular
sex
with
another
man
that
is
not
just
her
body
enjoying
such
an
arrangement
but
her
mind
too
whilst
pair
bonded
to
you
a
woman
is
a
completely
different
person
than
from
when
she
is
not
pair
bonded
to
you
the
cold
indifference
is
a
stark
contrast
from
the
loving
woman
of
perhaps
a
month
or
two
prior
it's
the
difference
between
her
relationship
with
you
in
a
pair
bonded
and
a
non
pair
bonded
state
i
think
many
many
men
can
relate
to
this
behaviour
from
their
own
experiences
many
men
have
noted
how
easily
women
seem
to
move
on
and
how
effortlessly
they
branch
swing
even
after
long
long
relationships
lasting
years
they
seem
to
have
this
ability
to
easily
find
meaningful
relationships
elsewhere
whereas
a
man
who
had
a
long
relationship
with
a
woman
typically
does
not
find
it
so
easy
to
just
replace
his
wife
out
of
the
blue
because
things
got
boring
add
a
mistress
to
the
rotation
sure
but
he's
still
there
for
his
wife
and
he's
still
willing
to
fuck
her
men
don't
just
stop
loving
you
because
you
don't
make
them
tingle
anymore
unlike
women
men
stop
loving
you
when
you
stop
displaying
femininity
towards
them
it's
as
if
women
are
programmed
only
to
respect
and
respond
well
to
the
man
fucking
them
the
best
if
a
woman
runs
a
harem
of
men
she'll
love
whoever
fucks
her
the
best
despite
who
her
husband
is
meant
to
be
if
a
man
runs
a
harem
he's
still
capable
of
loving
his
wife
despite
all
the
side
pussy
he's
getting
he
doesn't
think
oh
shit
this
airheads
pussy
is
so
nice
i'm
going
to
leave
my
wife
over
it
cheating
on
your
partner
seems
to
affect
the
genders
differently
i
would
love
for
them
to
do
studies
on
this
shit
backup
the
conjecture
of
my
observations
with
some
science
rice
kids
complain
too
damn
much
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
world
you
have
a
pretty
good
life
most
of
us
will
go
on
to
get
really
good
jobs
and
live
really
good
lives
we
are
attending
a
very
prestigious
university
and
are
offered
opportunities
that
most
would
sacrifice
everything
for
you
complain
that
you're
not
happy
at
rice
because
you
don't
have
friends
there
are
people
out
there
with
no
families
due
to
hate
crimes
and
civil
war
you
complain
about
homework
some
people
can't
go
to
college
because
they
can't
even
afford
it
on
loans
hate
the
servery
food
there
are
children
everywhere
who
would
be
happy
to
have
what
you
eat
in
a
meal
for
a
week
there
are
people
starving
to
death
being
murdered
and
just
having
all
around
worse
lives
than
your
over
dramatic
ass
the
next
time
you're
sad
because
no
one
wants
to
hug
you
think
about
the
child
who
doesn't
even
have
arms
anymore
to
give
hugs
if
you're
sad
get
some
help
if
you're
too
afraid
or
embarrassed
to
get
help
maybe
you
don't
actually
need
it
and
you
need
to
re
evaluate
your
priorities
in
life
don't
apologize
for
the
opportunities
you
were
given
and
where
you
came
from
but
at
the
same
time
don't
take
them
for
granted
and
waste
your
talents
ungrateful
ass
what
do
white
guys
think
of
hispanic
girls
i
feel
as
though
they
just
look
right
past
us
as
a
girl
from
the
country
i
personally
have
never
dated
a
guy
who
isn't
white
but
it
seems
harder
to
get
a
guys
attention
here
hmm
10420
i'm
just
a
half
asian
girl
looking
for
my
half
asian
boy
where
are
they
why
is
it
okay
for
beyonce
to
make
50
million
promoting
crap
and
not
okay
for
a
ceo
who
"3,000"
employees
and
100
million
in
profit
to
make
5
million
for
himself
this
is
not
even
a
conservative
post
it
is
just
common
sense
why
don't
people
question
shit
instead
of
automatically
wanting
to
crucify
ceo's
now
i
can
understand
ceos
that
sponsor
politicians
like
walmart
who
gave
obama
30
million
but
can't
give
their
employees
more
than
minimum
wage
but
why
do
people
hate
a
small
time
business
owner
who
started
his
business
from
scratch
taxing
them
doesn't
help
shit
it
hurts
people
because
he
has
to
lay
people
off
to
stay
in
business
i
am
not
conservative
i
don't
label
myself
to
such
things
however
i
will
admit
they
have
a
better
understanding
of
basic
economics
than
liberals
17332
i
wrote
a
note
to
this
guy
i
really
like
because
i'm
too
nervous
to
talk
with
him
to
face
to
face
his
large
muscles
and
tanned
polish
skin
literally
render
me
speechless
would
it
be
creepy
to
give
the
note
to
him
and
walk
away
i'm
struggling
because
i
really
want
him
to
know
how
i
feel
it
kind
of
upsets
me
when
people
treat
the
christian
sororities
on
campus
as
real
sororities
i
understand
that
it's
a
great
way
to
meet
people
they
are
all
extremely
fantastic
human
beings
however
if
you
are
an
atheist
have
repeatedly
stated
so
with
no
plans
of
allowing
jesus
in
your
life
and
even
go
as
far
as
not
allowing
crosses
in
your
apartment
why
are
you
rushing

i'm
a
rising
senior
and
an
international
student
my
parents
can
never
afford
to
come
to
ithaca
for
my
graduation
next
year
i'm
studying
here
on
a
scholarship
and
i'm
grateful
for
it
but
i
honestly
can't
save
up
4000
to
bring
them
over
plus
it's
a
two
days
long
journey
and
would
be
taxing
for
my
aging
parents
they
don't
speak
english
and
have
never
been
on
a
plane
i
saw
my
graduating
friends
pictures
and
everybody
had
their
families
with
them
is
it
common
at
all
to
be
without
your
family
on
graduation
i
feel
so
guilty
for
not
being
able
to
bring
my
parents
here
like
others
do
i'm
tired
of
people
in
the
lgbtq
community
who
think
it's
annoying
when
straight
people
claim
themselves
as
allies
often
saying
that
straight
people
shouldn't
be
proud
as
allies
just
because
they
aren't
homophobic
but
in
the
end
isn't
that
what
lgbtq
wants
a
massive
decrease
if
not
a
total
end
of
homophobia
2807
all
i
want
is
a
nice
jewish
girl
or
really
any
nice
girl
even
though
my
grandma
wouldn't
be
happy
is
that
too
much
to
ask
13655
do
christians
know
that
jesus
in
reality
was
far
from
a
white
man
with
long
white
beard
and
hair
why
do
natives
do
not
mingle
with
internationals
students
on
campus
it
hurts
when
people
ignore
you
i'm
looking
for
a
church
to
attend
next
semester
when
i
start
at
a
m
i
was
baptized
methodist
and
spent
most
of
my
childhood
going
to
a
methodist
church
but
then
started
going
to
a
large
nondenominational
church
which
i
ended
up
feeling
more
comfortable
at
however
in
the
past
couple
of
years
my
church
going
habits
have
become
poor
i
really
want
to
start
regularly
going
to
church
again
next
semester
so
are
there
any
methodist
or
nondenominational
churches
in
or
around
college
station
y'all
recommend
tl
dr
need
recommendations
for
methodist
or
nondenominational
churches
in
cstat
i'm
quite
bothered
that
there
are
actually
people
both
white
and
black
who
have
a
problem
with
the
cheerios
commercial
featuring
the
biracial
family
i
just
thought
it
was
cute
and
didn't
think
much
about
it
until
later
when
i
considered
that
it
was
probably
the
first
biracial
all
american
family
i'd
seen
on
tv
and
even
that
bothers
me
a
little
there
are
tons
of
mixed
race
families
all
across
america
including
mine
so
why
don't
we
see
more
of
these
types
of
families
in
advertising
10246
people
look
at
me
and
right
away
assume
i'm
white
along
with
other
things
that
people
associate
with
being
white
except
i'm
not
i'm
mexican
and
cuban
back
home
people
sometimes
said
mean
things
like
gringa
but
i'm
hispanic
and
i
speak
spanish
and
here
people
think
i'm
being
racist
when
i
talk
about
mexican
jokes
and
things
like
george
lopez's
childhood
what
do
i
have
to
do
wear
a
sign
write
on
my
forehead
or
can
we
just
not
assume
others's
ethnicities
i've
seen
this
sort
of
thing
happen
to
friends
too
gays
are
born
gay
right
well
if
that's
the
case
aren't
pedophiles
born
pedophiles
so
according
to
you
gay
rights
activists
who
are
we
to
tell
men
in
their
40s
that
they
cannot
have
sexual
relations
with
a
10
year
old
it's
discrimination
we
should
throw
parades
that
exhibit
the
love
between
a
grown
man
woman
and
a
child
and
flaunt
their
relationship
in
everyone's
face
i
mean
it's
natural
right
it's
just
love
as
long
as
the
child
consents
right
i
mean
come
on
our
ancestors
as
adults
would
normally
marry
woman
when
they
were
twelve
so
it's
been
going
on
for
a
while
now
guys
don't
be
intolerant
and
bigoted
towards
pedophilia
just
like
homosexuality
it's
natural
and
right
and
who
are
we
to
intervene
in
such
a
relationship
people
just
can't
help
who
they
love
isn't
that
right
2415
my
parents
come
into
the
city
every
week
to
see
me
and
my
sister
and
they
bring
for
each
of
us
a
bag
full
of
usually
perishable
and
homemade
food
that
they
have
no
other
way
to
get
rid
of
whenever
we
tell
them
it's
too
much
they
tell
us
to
offer
it
to
friends
roommates
suitemates
people
in
our
dorm
etc
and
i
hate
telling
her
that
no
one
else
eats
it
no
matter
how
much
i
offer
it
i
hate
that
bag
of
food
more
and
more
every
week
because
it's
food
that
i'm
so
used
to
eating
with
other
people
and
i
know
i'll
have
to
eat
it
alone
and
throw
out
and
waste
whatever
i
can't
finish
because
it
goes
bad
coming
from
a
culture
that
always
shares
food
it
even
starts
to
taste
disgusting
when
i'm
alone
last
night
i
posted
a
picture
of
a
whole
tray
of
food
to
my
dorm's
group
page
telling
everyone
that
i
hate
wasting
food
and
that
anyone
who
wants
food
should
come
get
it
the
first
and
only
comment
was
how
do
i
know
it's
not
poisoned
it
got
a
like
what
the
actual
fuck
offended
and
embarrassed
i
deleted
the
post
and
threw
the
whole
week's
worth
of
food
down
the
garbage
chute
tray
and
all
i
know
this
is
the
city
and
you
should
be
wary
of
strangers
but
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
asshole
says
that
to
another
member
of
his
her
college
dorm
community
those
kinds
of
idiots
don't
understand
the
attempt
to
relate
and
communicate
and
they
shouldn't
say
anything
at
all
i
am
so
fucking
tired
of
this
shit
310
i
go
to
notre
dame
and
i
just
saw
this
page
because
my
friend
liked
a
post
on
here
as
someone
who
is
straight
as
an
arrow
and
pro
gay
rights
but
sees
lgbt
students
at
notre
dame
get
hated
by
a
reasonably
small
yet
very
vocal
section
of
campus
every
day
of
the
year
except
for
today
apparently
it's
gay
rights
day
at
nd
i
would
like
to
remind
the
lgbt
community
at
georgetown
that
well
at
least
you
don't
go
to
my
school
i
have
many
a
friend
at
georgetown
and
by
their
description
of
what
the
georgetown
community
is
like
i
have
to
say
props
guys
for
being
the
loving
welcoming
and
socially
responsible
yet
not
religiously
hateful
community
that
nd
was
meant
to
be
i
don't
understand
why
gay
marriage
is
such
an
issue
like
really
we
are
going
to
deny
them
the
right
to
marry
just
because
he
she
likes
his
her
own
gender
dude
that's
one
of
he
most
stupid
things
i've
ever
heard
i'm
a
straight
christian
black
man
and
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
girls
loving
girls
and
guys
loving
guys
i
just
think
most
people
need
to
get
off
their
high
horse
and
let
people
live
their
lives
i
mean
damn
my
best
friend
kissing
her
girlfriend
has
no
effect
on
my
life
or
your's
at
all
jr
9822
i
think
it's
ridiculous
how
much
hillel
is
used
as
a
feeder
organization
to
get
students
to
join
greek
life
sometimes
i
feel
like
there's
no
place
for
me
there
because
if
you
aren't
in
greek
like
you
are
super
religious
but
i
am
neither
it's
ridiculous
there's
even
a
jewish
greek
council
like
what
do
they
even
do
question
for
the
religious
women
here
can
you
see
yourself
dating
anyone
outside
your
religion
for
example
if
you
are
a
christian
could
you
see
yourself
dating
a
jew
muslim
or
even
an
atheist
if
no
why
in
one
of
my
classes
there
is
this
very
attractive
girl
that
i
am
certain
we
are
both
interested
in
each
other
i
have
talked
to
her
on
a
few
occasions
and
gotten
to
know
a
little
about
her
however
i
think
she
is
very
religious
and
i
haven't
stepped
foot
in
a
church
in
i
couldn't
tell
you
how
long
i'm
not
a
bad
person
or
a
bad
boy
i
just
don't
go
to
church
should
i
stop
while
i'm
still
ahead
2841
is
it
so
wrong
to
just
want
to
have
dated
at
least
one
person
by
now
i
mean
i
don't
really
need
to
be
with
anyone
but
its
just
kind
of
demoralizing
that
no
one
ever
shows
any
interest
like
fuck.am
i
ugly
am
i
too
fat
am
i
ethnically
displeasing
girls
that
think
guys
don't
get
image
problems
are
solo
wrong
i'm
not
saying
ladies
don't
have
it
hard
but
don't
think
guys
are
immune
since
i
was
like
13
i've
worried
i'll
get
fatter
and
that
i
am
already
fat
like
wtf
i
weight
170
and
am
like
6'4
i'm
damn
near
underwear
for
my
height
furthermore
i
am
not
white
and
its
hard
enough
being
a
minority
in
a
diverse
city
but
moving
to
oregon
kind
of
just
makes
me
never
want
to
go
downtown
alone
b
c
then
i'll
no
one
to
distract
me
from
the
feeling
of
everyone
looking
at
me
like
hey
a
black
person
sometimes
i
just
sit
there
and
think
if
i
were
white
someone
would
want
to
date
me
because
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
say
i
wouldn't
want
to
date
me
it
really
kind
of
hurts
why
are
women
still
allowed
to
drive
fed
up
male
driver
i
haven't
gone
to
breakaway
because
i
am
catholic
can
somebody
explain
what
breakaway
really
is
about
7235
there's
this
cute
little
indian
chick
that's
commented
on
a
few
posts
on
this
page
recently
wednesday
i
find
myself
wondering
what
type
of
guys
she
likes
or
if
she's
single
where
can
i
find
her
in
this
sea
of
cornellians
11320
extremely
nervous
about
posting
this
but
are
there
any
orthodox
christians
at
cornell
university
i
love
espn
but
i
hate
doris
burke
why
is
a
woman
commentating
a
game
she
can't
even
play
you
don't
agree
with
us
you're
racist
truly
is
a
sad
day
in
brown
university
history
don't
hate
cpax
just
cause
you
know
she's
right
so
i'm
involved
in
a
church
here
that
has
small
groups
my
anxiety
sky
rockets
when
someone
starts
talking
about
gays
because
i
know
of
a
family
and
they
have
a
total
of
like
5
gays
including
extended
family
all
of
them
are
blood
related
so
what's
other
peoples
opinion
on
gay
being
genetic
i
will
never
bring
this
up
at
church
again
because
they
will
just
sit
there
and
be
totally
against
people
being
gay
most
of
my
church
friends
also
say
that
they
can
choose
not
to
follow
their
temptations
but
could
my
church
friends
choose
not
follow
their
temptations
with
the
opposite
sex
i
don't
think
so
i
know
i
couldn't
stay
away
from
the
opposite
sex
all
my
life
a
friend
a
kenyon
student
confided
in
me
that
she
was
raped
by
another
student
who
i
know
this
student
has
apparently
also
raped
at
least
one
other
person
as
well
the
more
time
passes
the
more
i
feel
compelled
to
do
something
but
i
don't
want
to
violate
my
friend's
confidence

girls
did
you
ever
stop
and
think
that
maybe
you're
the
ones
that
should
put
the
seat
up
we
don't
like
touching
it
either
and
all
you
ever
do
is
whine
about
equality
how
about
some
equality
in
bathroom
etiquette
to
the
op
who
sat
next
to
a
turban
guy
let
me
tell
you
three
things
1
sikhs
tie
turban
in
the
us
muslims
don't
these
are
two
separate
religions
you
are
really
dumb
for
generalizing
based
off
media
2
even
if
i
was
a
muslim
then
what
you
are
a
judgmental
and
shallow
minded
person
for
thinking
every
muslim
is
the
same
3
you
are
nothing
more
than
an
anonymous
loser
who
spreads
hate
behind
an
anonymous
post
if
you
had
the
balls
you
would
talk
in
person
and
find
out
if
i
listen
to
your
crap
maybe
you
are
embarrassed
that
your
ignorance
is
so
strong
that
even
your
fully
aware
friends
will
laugh
at
you
next
time
you
see
a
guy
with
a
turban
ask
them
what
turban
means
and
they
will
tell
you
that
turban
is
their
commitment
towards
standing
up
for
others
too
bad
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
ask
a
sikh
for
help
because
you
are
a
judgmental
bigot
if
you
ever
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
and
at
the
level
of
your
ignorance
feel
free
to
get
a
turban
tied
on
the
tie
a
turban
day
or
reach
out
to
sikh
student
association
ps
no
matter
how
much
of
an
asshole
you
turn
out
to
be
sikhs
will
always
pray
for
your
well
being
because
we
pray
for
blessings
for
everyone

sometimes
i
feel
like
a
hater
but
it's
hard
not
to
compare
myself
to
people
i'm
sick
of
fb
statuses
about
people's
straight
a's
at
community
colleges
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
anyone
who
cannot
afford
or
immediately
attend
a
4
year
institution
and
yet
still
finds
a
way
to
pursue
higher
education
however
i
wish
they
could
be
a
little
less
egotistical
about
their
grades
i
don't
need
to
read
about
or
see
the
picture
of
your
100
score
on
an
algebra
test
like
it's
high
school
good
for
you
that
you
finally
learned
or
are
relearning
something
we
should
have
mastered
in
the
junior
high
we
both
attended
tell
your
friends
and
family
privately
they'll
still
congratulate
you
i
miss
the
super
high
grades
that
no
longer
come
easily
and
of
course
i
need
to
quit
b
tching
on
fb
and
go
study
i
will
it's
just
that
sometimes
i
think
coming
here
was
a
mistake
if
i'd
gone
to
an
easier
school
i
would
probably
have
a
higher
gpa
yes
increased
competition
could
augment
work
ethic
but
i
think
the
converse
is
true
in
my
case
and
self
esteem
what
if
cornell
never
becomes
worth
it
for
me
and
i've
wasted
all
this
time
and
money
to
become
a
housewife
and
stay
at
home
mom
which
are
perfectly
fine
occupations
if
that's
what
you're
into
but
i
would
hate
myself
8895
i
think
all
the
fighting
against
slut
shaming
is
stupid
if
a
girl
or
guy
is
the
kind
of
person
to
go
after
other
people's
significant
others
and
use
their
bodies
and
sex
to
get
what
they
want
in
life
should
we
all
be
up
in
arms
to
defend
them
that
behavior
is
morally
wrong
regardless
of
what
religion
if
at
all
one
chooses
to
practice
seems
like
the
urge
to
be
politically
correct
these
days
have
made
disliking
anything
or
any
activity
wrong
3314
over
the
past
couple
years
patriotism
has
made
me
uneasy
i'd
like
to
think
i
am
a
citizen
of
earth
before
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
patriotism
just
seems
like
it
promotes
too
much
of
an
us
versus
them
mentality
anyone
else
agree
the
only
reason
girls
here
become
feminists
is
because
they
don't
get
that
dope
dick
i
mean
have
you
ever
come
across
a
hot
feminist
i
think
not
778
only
6
of
blacks
and
8
of
hispanics
attend
georgetown
compared
to
62
of
whites
i'm
pretty
sure
these
statistics
match
every
other
top
school
shutup
about
affirmative
action
as
if
its
this
uber
generous
policy
there
are
too
many
factors
that
go
into
accepting
a
student
anyway
outside
of
race
how
about
you
point
your
finger
at
legacy
students
with
mediocre
grades
instead
of
non
white
students
please
and
thank
you
someone
who
is
absolutely
tired
of
the
affirmative
action
posts
from
these
racist
whites
who
think
they
have
some
sort
of
entitlement
to
a
quality
education
in
case
you're
wondering
this
entire
country
is
skewed
towards
the
betterment
of
your
race
historically
and
even
now
sorry
if
non
whites
would
like
to
use
their
small
window
of
opportunity
to
better
themselves
get
a
grip
i
fully
support
and
think
that
gay
marriage
should
be
legalized
for
equality
reasons
yet
every
time
i
see
a
gay
couple
walking
around
together
i
cringe
inside
how
can
something
i
so
whole
heatedly
support
make
me
so
disgusted
does
this
make
me
a
hypocrite
5304
is
leonardo
dicaprio
seriously
playing
dr
martin
luther
king
jr
in
a
movie
fuck
this
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
a
man
of
color
will
be
able
to
play
me
in
a
movie
when
there
are
so
many
roles
out
there
for
leo
to
play
and
so
many
brilliant
black
actors
out
there
to
play
this
amazing
man
and
world
leader
how
can
we
do
this
it
feels
like
a
slap
in
the
face
again
watch
this
whole
movie
before
you
open
your
mouth
then
try
and
say
the
damage
of
racism
against
whites
isn't
just
as
serious
as
the
damage
of
racism
against
blacks

i'm
a
gay
man
who
has
such
a
big
thing
for
indian
accents
why
can't
more
indian
boys
be
curious
so
this
girl
what
can
i
say
we
have
such
similar
life
philosophies
even
when
we
differ
on
things
i
love
the
way
she
thinks
she
thinks
she
looks
like
a
nervous
wreck
but
i
find
elegance
in
her
simplicity
her
lack
of
vanity
i
would
seriously
marry
her
in
a
heartbeat
if
she
wanted
despite
my
ignorant
folly
of
married
life
i
would
try
my
best
to
make
it
work
because
it
would
feel
so
right
even
though
she
graduates
this
year
i
at
least
want
her
to
realize
she
was
loved
while
at
rice
but
if
i
tell
her
would
it
break
our
friendship
and
destroy
a
connection
that
i
find
precious
oh
there's
another
problem
she's
muslim
and
i
am
not
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
it
at
all
i
would
convert
naturally
but
i
feel
she
would
take
issue
or
her
family
would
there's
going
to
be
a
torturous
inner
battle
raging
in
me
for
the
next
two
months
but
in
the
end
why
are
people
so
prejudiced
towards
racists
why
can't
we
just
believe
what
we
want
to
without
anyone
giving
us
crap
about
it
18600
some
of
my

uploaded
their

cute
i
resent
boys
who
try
to
hold
doors
open
for
me
do
you
think
i
can't
do
it
myself
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
women
will
not
be
judged
on
their
sexuality
but
on
the
content
of
their
character
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
the
chick
who
is
really
good
at
the
bj
the
hj
and
the
zj
will
be
held
in
the
same
esteem
as
the
chick
who
decided
that
she
likes
being
a
virgin
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
people
will
shut
the
fuck
up
about
women
and
sex
and
let
them
have
their
fun
too
it's
called
experience
people
if
a
girl
is
willing
to
have
sex
with
you
and
you
alone
after
trying
100
other
dudes
you're
doing
something
right
if
she's
clean
why
the
fuck
do
you
care
wah
wah
cry
about
it
posted
in
the
open
because
come
at
me
puritan
bros

repressed
sexuality
will
not
hamper
me
from
applauding
those
women
who
know
what
they're
doing
you
don't
like
being
called
a
puritan
taint
licking

nozzle
so
let's
cut
down
on
the
slut
shaming
shall

i
don't
know
why
i'm
so
afraid
to

you
seem
nice
enough
are
you
in
the
annex
white
guy
comes
and
sits
with
me
and
my
black
friend
sorry
skin
color
is
important
for
the
story
white
guy
to
friend
ya
bring
me
my
grape
flavored
kool
aid
guys
friend:yeah
ya
fucken
racists
white
guy
looks
up
at
my
black
friend
scared
shitless
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
you
made
my
night
that
you
legit
got
scared
and
he
didnt
even
notice
17324
as
a
latin
american
i
find
it
funny
that
latinos
are
more
sensible
to
cultural
stereotypes
and
racism
than
ourselves
the
so
much
racist
stereotypes
that
you
are
talking
about
are
common
topics
in
our
countries
and
we
are
used
to
them
because
even
if
you
dont
want
to
admit
show
part
of
our
culture
just
look
at
their
shows
in
univision
or
local
channels
do
you
know
la
india
maria
la
hora
pico
hector
suarez
puro
loco
just
to
mention
a
few
comedic
shows
that
use
the
racist
stereotypes
that
you
feel
offended
by
as
a
source
of
humor
and
do
you
see
in
this
case
mexicans
offended
about
it
they
know
some
of
the
topics
touched
are
true
and
before
you
bring
the
white
oppression
influencing
mexican
culture
it
is
already
embedded
in
their
culture
seriously
we
latin
americans
have
more
important
things
to
worry
about
that
people
using
stereotypes
we
left
our
countries
for
a
reason
and
we
know
how
harsh
is
living
in
those
countries
were
racial
slurs
are
nothing
compared
to
not
knowing
if
you
will
be
able
to
eat
or
even
live
the
following
day
this
is
why
a
latin
american
latino
people
get
all
butthurt
about
women
not
being
allowed
to
vote
until
the
1900s
but
think
about
it
it
makes
sense
ever
met
a
woman
who
wasn't
indecisive
if
we
let
them
vote
it'll
take
up
the
entire
damn
voting
time
because
they'll
be
hogging
the
booth
until
they
finally
make
a
decision
you
mean
you're
a
christian
and
are
outraged
that
your
tax
dollars
are
going
toward
healthcare
for
poor
people
funny
jesus
told
people
to
help
the
less
fortunate
stop
being
so
hypocritical
gay
kids
are
bullied
okay
sorry
you
know
what
disgusts
me
though
the
way
cc
treats
kids
who
don't
support
homosexuality
does
anyone
have
the
right
to
their
own
opinion
if
it's
not
liberal
in
thought
if
we're
such
an
accepting
community
why
do
we
shove
the
pro
homosexuality
side
down
everyone's
throat
this
coming
from
someone
who
supports
gay
marriage

i
want
people
to
know
that
there
is
a
flying
spaghetti
monster
who
loves
and
wants
to
help
you
through
your
problems
only
if
you
let
him
her
the
warm
weather
your
boyfriend
your
girlfriend
drinking
having
sex
good
grades
good
friends
they're
a
temporary
fix
what
will
you
turn
to
if
and
when
these
things
are
gone
my
confession
i've
found
the
one
thing
in
life
that
is
constant
true
and
never
fails
me
his
her
name
is
the
flying
spaghetti
monster
give
him
her
a
chance
i've
been
seeing
a
lot
of
hate
against
white
people
this
year
on
cc
confessions
and
i
was
wondering
where
it
all
came
from
honestly
we
have
allowed
some
really
racist
sentiments
to
flourish
and
i
think
its
detrimental
to
any
discussion
on
race
because
it
allows
for
a
white
students
opinion
to
be
ignored
and
given
no
weight
just
because
of
their
skin
color
i'm
hearing
all
this
back
and
forth
about
the
article
and
in
the
catalyst
and
i
think
that
honestly
everybody's
a
little
in
the
wrong
yes
the
article
could
have
been
written
better
and
shouldn't
have
attacked
the
people
it
did
without
first
discussing
it
with
them
to
at
least
present
their
side
from
what
i've
been
told
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
a
response
after
the
article
was
written
but
unfortunately
the
article
was
submitted
too
late
for
the
need
for
a
rebuttal
to
be
fully
understood
or
completed
and
truthfully
yes
there
are
aspects
of
feminist
rhetoric
on
campus
that
do
need
changing
that's
generally
the
state
of
any
controversial
issue
on
campus
and
we
all
need
to
be
aware
of
that
and
to
try
to
move
forward
to
make
things
better
however
i
don't
think
the
other
side
fully
appreciates
all
the
things
feminists
do
on
campus
yes
people
may
feel
alienated
by
certain
wording
but
you
have
to
understand
that
the
monthly
rag
does
its
best
in
trying
to
inform
and
educate
in
the
way
that
they
know
how
it
doesn't
make
them
right
or
wrong
it
simply
is
a
point
of
view
my
point
is
i
get
it
you
feel
like
feminist
rhetoric
excludes
people
on
campus
it
doesn't
intend
to
but
that's
generally
the
nature
of
the
beast
if
you
actually
want
to
change
that
you
can't
just
write
an
angry
article
in
the
catalyst
defaming
feminism
on
campus
that
will
only
do
more
harm
than
it
can
ever
do
good
maybe
instead
of
taking
the
indirect
approach
maybe
get
involved
feminism
on
campus
won't
change
unless
you
change
with
it
and
help
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
everyone
so
take
a
feminist
and
gender
studies
class
attend
a
femco
meeting
step
outside
your
box
yes
it
will
be
difficult
because
oftentimes
we
are
set
in
our
ways
but
feminists
on
campus
want
to
work
with
you
they
aren't
scary
i
promise
you
have
to
be
willing
to
take
that
chance
and
try
to
make
a
change
because
i
can't
honestly
say
that
you
have
the
right
to
defame
an
underrepresented
voice
on
this
campus
if
you
aren't
willing
to
take
the
time
to
investigate
what
they
do
and
why
they
say
things
that
way
we
are
all
angry
and
everybody
is
entitled
in
their
own
way
the
question
is
are
we
actually
going
to
do
something
productive
with
that
anger
or
are
we
going
to
let
this
incident
fester
within
our
community
so
that
when
the
next
one
comes
around
all
we
can
think
to
do
is
lash
out
i
can't
wait
for
the
day
whether
it
be
15
years
or
50
that
our
children
grandchildren
will
be
just
confused
about
the
laws
forbidding
pedophilic
marriage
as
we
are
confused
about
the
laws
forbidding
interracial
marriage
i
remember
learning
about
the
civil
rights
movement
and
being
so
confused
as
to
why
black
people
couldn't
vote
why
black
and
white
kids
couldn't
use
the
same
water
fountain
why
the
races
weren't
equal
when
it
comes
to
pedophilia
it
shouldn't
be
done
they
still
say
wasn't
it
loving
v
virginia
1967
that
declared
marriage
was
one
of
the
basic
civil
rights
and
the
right
to
marry
was
a
fundamental
freedom
are
loving
and
consenting
children
and
adults
not
to
be
treated
equally
whether
you
agree
or
not
it's
a
question
of
equality
really
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
don't
agree
with
it
just
like
many
of
our
grandparents
or
great
grandparents
don't
agree
with
interracial
marriage
we
the
people
have
rights
and
as
an
american
i
personally
would
not
deny
minorities
the
freedoms
i
have
when
will
your
prejudices
stop
i
hope
they
will
when
your
child
or
grandchild
has
to
ask
why
was
the
world
such
an
unequal
place

i
think
my
boyfriend
is
in
the
closet
we
recently
started
dating
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
how
do
i
approach
this
hey
guys
i'm
a
transfer
for
the
fall
from
ut
el
paso
to
a
m
i'm
an
indian
male
can
anybody
tell
me
what
the
scene
is
like
for
indian
asians
at
texas
a
m
please
and
tell
me
if
i
will
encounter
racism
my
father
wants
me
to
go
to
texas
a
m
but
if
people
there
hate
asians
then
i
will
definitely
stay
away

i
change
pronouns
in
a
lot
of
my
love
related
confessions
because
i'm
gay
i'm
not
ashamed
of
it
but
historically
once
i've
disclosed
my
sexuality
in
a
post
that's
all
people
can
focus
on
i
don't
get
the
same
kind
of
dating
advice
or
support
from
the
cornell
community
because
people
are
too
tripped
up
on
my
sexuality
to
even
realize
i
have
relationship
problems
too
it's
not
like
the
cornell
community
is
being
malicious
or
that
they
can't
understand
it's
just
that
my
confession
get's
lost
under
all
the
hustle
bustle
of
being
gay
if
people
knew
how
hard
it
was
to
be
gay
here
i
think
they
would
take
it
a
bit
more
seriously
you
think
you
guys
have
trouble
finding
a
serious
relationship
imagine
having
a
population
about
1
10th
the
size
to
work
with
now
imagine
having
to
deal
with
the
social
stigma
of
being
gay
once
you
actually
do
find
someone
you're
interested
in
how
many
times
have
you
seen
two
guys
kissing
in
public
or
even
holding
hands
i'm
not
saying
that
gay
couples
don't
do
those
things
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
really
difficult
being
gay
here
much
harder
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i'm
a
very
open
happy
and
well
liked
person
on
campus
but
i'm
very
lonely
sometimes
i
am
so
sad
about
graduating
from
cornell
but
i'm
hoping
it'll
open
a
new
chapter
in
my
romantic
life
here's
to
hoping
15240
speaking
of
interracial
relationships
i'm
a
latino
and
i
date
white
girls
almost
exclusively
latinas
on
occasion
they're
usually
bored
of
plain
ol
white
boys
want
to
experience
a
different
culture
and
like
it
when
i
speak
to
them
in
spanish
where
are
my
beautiful
white
women
at
i
mean
donde
estan
mis
hermosas
mujeres
blancas
d
my
mom
bought
this
vile
piece
of
hatred
and
cultural
appropriation
i
try
to
educate
her
but
i
worry
that
she
will
always
be
a
subhuman
bigot
maybe
if
i
socially
ostracize
her
and
prevent
her
from
speaking
to
me
she
will
gain
some
empathy
i'm
so
glad
i
can
find
true
family
at
brown
anyways
paul
newman
is
a
racist
white
egotist
who
thinks
that
donating
to
charity
absolves
him
of
responsibility
doesn't
this
sound
familiar
don't
buy
his
products
is
there
a
gay
friendly
church
i
used
to
go
to
st
mary's
but
several
people
were
discouraging
of
me
being
who
i
am
thank
you
i
love
how
racist
white
people
here
are
so
against
other
cultures
yet
so
willing
to
eat
the
food

i've
always
wanted
to
date
a
white
guy
where
are
the
white
guys
with
jungle
fever
i
hate
impact
camp
and
the
majority
of
people
that
attended
and
that
were
counselors
i
felt
like
everything
was
superficial
and
fake
the
first
day
i
will
not
forget
how
offending
it
was
listening
to
my
ignorant
bg
mom
counselor
talk
about
how
bad
fish
camp
was
because
there
were
gays
tattoos
and
gauges
i
felt
like
i
couldn't
talk
to
a
single
guy
in
the
camp
without
feeling
like
a
whore
because
there
was
gender
segregation
and
lots
of
it
they
had
like
three
bible
studies
a
day
kill
me
i'm
not
an
atheist
but
i
just
felt
like
people
were
shoving
bibles
down
my
throat
it
made
me
so
uncomfortable
and
they
placed
the
emphasis
on
guilting
people
into
loving
god
and
acting
like
you
had
to
be
a
certain
way
to
be
loved
by
him
rather
than
expressing
god's
universal
love
for
all
people
as
all
sins
are
equal
i
just
could
not
stand
it
and
coming
to
a
m
that
bad
experience
makes
me
avoid
church
and
i
still
can't
even
go
because
every
time
i
go
someone
mentions
impact
and
how
great
it
was
and
i'm
just
like
that
was
the
worst
week
of
my
life
and
my
parents
forced
me
to
go
i
was
hoping
the
christian
community
at
a
m
would
be
accepting
but
all
it
is
is
superficial
people
that
go
to
breakaway
and
sing
like
they
love
god
and
then
sin
constantly
while
condemning
people
with
gays
tattoos
and
gauges
and
anyone
else
who
doesn't
fit
their
stereotype
as
the
right
type
of
christian
i
wish
i
could
commit
to
a
church
but
almost
all
the
christians
here
seem
fake
and
even
saying
i'm
christian
to
anyone
makes
me
ashamed
because
i
don't
want
them
to
associate
me
with
those
types
of
people
oh
and
as
a
note
to
my
impact
camp
for
all
of
you
who
thought
i
was
shy
and
quiet
i'm
actually
really
loud
and
crazy
and
goofy
and
fun
y'all
just
never
saw
that
because
of
how
utterly
uncomfortable
i
was
but
my
fish
camp
sure
did
i
made
my
best
friends
there
not
to
mention
i'm
a
counselor
now
so
how
about
them
nuggets
in
conclusion
how
about
all
you
impact
christians
hop
out
of
your
bubbles
and
look
beyond
the
surface
to
see
people
for
who
they
are
and
try
to
make
a
friend
without
bringing
up
god
in
the
conversation
justsayin
sorrynotsorry
if
you
aren't
religious
how
can
you
still
celebrate
easter
and
other
religious
holidays
i
find
this
contradicting
831
sometimes
i
feel
excluded
from
the
asian
community
is
it
really
because
i'm
too
americanized
don't
get
me
wrong
cause
i
love
all
my
friends
now
regardless
of
their
backgrounds
but
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
connect
with
my
culture
comfortably
12087
is
it
wrong
that
i
hate
being
referred
to
as
a
minority
and
rather
a
person
of
color
i
wonder
if
anyone
else
feels
some
sense
of
weirdness
from
that
word
5206
i
wish
i
could
relate
to
more
people
here
where
are
the
other
3rd
generation
asians
3656
are
there
any
east
african
here
hi
i'm
a
normal
guy
but
sometimes
my
friend
and
i
like
to
touch
our
penises
together
and
kiss
a
little
the
bible
says
that
homosexuality
is
wrong
but
this
doesn't
make
me
gay
does
it
why
do
black
girls
clap
their
hands
when
they're
arguing
with
someone
this
clap
is
clap
so
clap
annoying
360
i
try
to
convert
people
to
christianity
at
wednesday
convo
is
this
seat
saved
no
are
you
flirt
convert
67
why
are
all
these
half
asian
girls
so
goodamn
attractive
y'all
do
it
to
me
every
time
418
i
am
in
a
class
right
now
where
the
teacher
doesn't
call
on
women
as
much
as
men
and
when
women
do
get
to
talk
he's
way
more
likely
to
respond
to
their
comments
negatively
this
institutionalized
sexism
fucking
sucks
guys
what
do
i
do
13561
my
white
boyfriend
today
got
offended
when
i
called
him
a
racist
for
asking
if
i
was
trying
to
mimic
a
hispanic
accent
which
i
wasn't
but
thinks
it's
okay
to
say
ching
chong

when
you
find
your
ex
on
a
gay
hookup
site
a
couple
months
after
he
broke
up
with
you
you
know
it
was
for
the
best
why
can't
gays
here
be
anything
but
sluts
does
anyone
who
identifies
as
lgbt
find
the
phrase
bats
for
the
other
team
offensive
5660
why
is
everyone
so
concerned
with
finding
someone
of
a
particular
race
why
don't
people
just
want
to
be
with
an
amazing
person
no
matter
their
race
if
race
is
a
priority
in
your
significant
other
then
you
are
allowing
yourself
to
miss
out
on
some
truly
magnificent
people
13777
as
a
woman
i
still
don't
understand
these
complaints
of
discrimination
and
the
like
women
are
paid
less
really
for
the
same
job
women
are
sexualized
in
what
realm
porn
television
shows
don't
women
actively
participate
in
their
own
sexualization
ermagerd
slut
shaming
guise
men
are
often
shamed
for
having
multiple
partners
by
women
and
to
some
extent
other
men
i
can
think
of
only
one
current
issue
that
affects
women
more
so
than
men
and
needs
immediate
attention
rape
i
was
tempted
to
lump
that
together
with
other
violent
crimes
but
apparently
since
women
are
usually
the
victims
it
is
in
its
own
category
all
that
said
i
think
feminism
has
its
uses
just
don't
pretend
you're
oppressed
women
dwelling
in
countries
where
women
are
treated
as
dogs
would
be
insulted
also
if
someone
could
comment
on
what
i've
put
in
quotes
that'd
be
great
i
just
want
a
better
understanding
of
these
issues
2639
i
don't
get
why
most
people
at
nyu
all
of
them
it
seems
completely
reject
the
idea
of
god
if
you
are
so
smart
why
can't
you
at
least
acknowledge
that
there's
a
possibility
that
an
all
powerful
entity
could
exist
and
before
anyone
retorts
with
how
could
a
god
exist
look
at
how
terrible
the
earth
is
to
a
person
of
any
faith
this
place
isn't
our
final
destination
why
would
it
be
perfect
i'm
an
orthodox
sufi
muslim
and
my
goal
is
eternal
peace
8399
i
am
white
and
whenever
i
rap
along
with
the
music
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
am
allowed
to
say
the
n
word
i
know
it's
not
accepted
to
say
it
in
general
but
am
i
allowed
to
when
i'm
rapping
oh
p.s
i
wouldn't
make
a
big
deal
out
of
it
if
you
were
to
call
me
cracker
i'd
laugh
at
you
stop
being
hypocrites
13385
all
i
want
is
a
gay
german
boyfriend
is
that
too
much
to
ask
66
i
have
a
friend
who
is
obviously
gay
but
doesn't
know
it
yet
what
should
i
do
where
are
all
the
hot
gay
guys
apparently
not
at
rice
this
might
sound
racist
but
i
dont
think
i
am
just
that
people
i
hate
happened
to
be
black
like
those
girls
who
laugh
out
of
nowhere
in
the
hallway
getting
loud
and
shit
the
fuck
calm
yo
shit
trying
to
get
attention
and
always
with
i
am
shit
attitude
you
aint
shit
something
about
their
tone
and
attitude
just
brings
down
their
values
i
have
for
them
13590
i
hate
how
people
at
cornell
are
so
over
sensitive
about
everything
i'm
a
pre
frosh
and
i'm
worried
that
everything
i
say
will
offend
someone
because
i
don't
believe
in
things
like
feminism
protecting
the
environment
affirmative
action
or
financial
aid
will
people
at
cornell
respect
my
views
too
11914
watching
this
i
so
wish
i
could
just
be
a
four
year
old
kid
forever
you're
loved
by
all
you
love
all
you
don't
know
what's
black
what's
white
you
don't
care
if
anyone's
gay
or
lesbian
rich
or
poor
you
just
do
what
you
feel

do

remember
the

recess
man
that
show
brings
back
good
childhood
memories
my
favorite
episode
was
when
santa
clause
was
revealed
to
be
a
black
janitor
how
considerate
power
to
the
black
people
are
there
any
white
guys
interested
in
black
women
seriously
is
it
true
some
of
the
panhellenic
frats
here
on
campus
are
racist
i
looked
up
check
your
privilege
on
urban
dictionary
here's
what
it
had
to
say
about
it
a
term
screamed
by
far
left
sheltered
liberals
when
they
hear
a
white
person
say
something
that
might
offend
someone
that
isn't
a
straight
white
male
you
will
have
this
term
screamed
at
you
if
say
anything
offensive
to
the
lgbt
blacks
or
any
other
kind
of
person
thats
not
white
straight
or
male
the
term
is
stupid
because
while
these
hippie
liberals
think
these
minor
social
problems
are
big
in
america
and
that
those
affected
by
them
have
their
lives
ruined
by
any
kind
of
hatred
here
they
think
therefor
the
same
social
issues
are
a
big
deal
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
they
forget
that
places
like
somalia
exist
where
you
will
be
murdered
just
for
being
alive
let
alone
being
white
or
gay
can
i
get
an
amen
5447
i
am
a
person
of
color
and
i
feel
like
the
itooamnyu
movement
looks
like
a
bunch
of
us
minority
groups
bitching
about
random
shit
for
attention
instead
of
actively
working
to
stop
it
this
movement
excludes
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
our
allies
isn't
that
counterproductive
a
m
has
ruined
religion
for
me
everybody
here
is
your
typical
bible
thumping
evangelist
and
i
fucking
hate
it
im
so
tired
of
seeing
inspirational
god
quotes
written
all
over
my
dorm
bible
verses
written
on
the
sidewalks
people
coming
up
to
others
to
shove
god
down
their
throat
and
our
facebook
confessions
page
full
of
people
talking
about
how
much
they
love
god
im
fucking
sick
of
it
i
am
very
much
a
person
who
worships
privately
so
getting
all
this
shit
shoved
down
my
throat
constantly
is
getting
so
fucking
old
i
dont
need
some
fake
ass
sorority
girl
to
tell
me
that
they
can
save
my
soul
i
dont
want
to
look
at
another
confession
saying
direct
quote
god
designed
women
to
get
married
and
raise
a
family
to
get
to
heaventhat
is
the
ultimate
job
god
made
for
womenwomen
are
to
serve
their
families
like
jesus
because
jesus
was
the
servant
among
men
im
so
tired
of
my
family
telling
me
if
i
dont
get
to
church
every
single
sunday
im
going
to
hell
that
if
i
mess
up
one
time
there
is
no
forgiveness
im
tired
of
people
using
religion
as
fucking
leverage
to
get
me
to
do
what
they
want
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
the
majority
of
people
who
are
religious
are
fucking
ignorant
they
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
theyre
going
to
save
me
but
they
persecute
everybody
in
the
name
of
god
and
completely
ignore
the
fact
that
god
said
in
the
bible
to
love
everybody
and
let
him
do
the
judging
they
judge
and
persecute
everyone
anyway
and
still
hold
themselves
above
others
i
hate
all
of
this
im
fucking
done
being
catholic
i
hate
a
religion
that
is
inherently
sexist
and
discriminatory
im
not
doing
this
anymore
i
wish
so
bad
that
i
had
never
come
here
i
love
a
m
but
most
of
the
people
here
fucking
suck
theyre
a
bunch
of
intolerant
evangelist
wanna
be
rednecks
that
are
so
close
minded
that
its
physically
painful
so
fucking
thanks
to
everybody
who
ruined
the
one
thing
i
truly
appreciated
about
my
upbringing
15138
i'm
not
100
comfortable
around
gay
people
i
am
first
generation
american
born
and
raised
by
a
traditional
slightly
macho
immigrant
household
i
was
sent
to
a
catholic
school
grades
k
8
and
my
father
is
a
fervent
bible
reader.i
grew
up
in
nyc
submersed
in
an
urban
hip
hop
culture
which
frowns
upon
homosexuality
and
uses
gay
slurs
liberally
it
wasn't
until
i
started
college
and
ventured
into
the
world
of
academia
that
i
started
to
become
increasingly
appreciative
of
different
peoples
cultures
and
walks
of
life
now
don't
get
me
wrong
i'm
all
for
gay
rights
equality
tolerance
and
acceptance
if
you
asked
me
a
series
of
questions
i'd
give
you
all
the
right
answers
any
reasonable
just
person
would
and
should
give
i
can
talk
to
gay
people
treat
them
respectfully
and
don't
hate
them
in
any
way
or
think
they're
wrong
this
is
not
about
how
i
feel
about
gays
on
a
societal
or
ethical
level
i'm
agnostic
and
don't
subscribe
to
any
particular
set
of
tenets
this
is
just
about
me
personally
growing
up
i
never
really
had
much
interactions
with
gay
people
in
fact
it
wasn't
really
until
i
started
dating
my
ex
who
had
a
lot
of
gay
friends
that
i
started
being
exposed
to
gay
people
with
greater
frequency
and
i
realized
i
felt
a
bit
uncomfortable
however
i
wanted
to
force
myself
to
overcome
this
aversion
so
i
made
sure
to
be
social
and
would
even
go
out
to
gay
bars
clubs
with
my
ex
and
her
friends
sometimes
i
figured
the
more
i
expose
myself
to
being
around
gay
people
the
quicker
i'll
get
over
myself
unfortunately
even
after
all
that
and
even
after
many
other
subsequent
interactions
with
gay
people
i
still
don't
feel
fully
comfortable
around
them
the
fact
that
i'm
what
some
would
consider
a
good
looking
metrosexual
doesn't
really
help
either
because
often
times
my
interactions
with
gay
people
result
in
them
hitting
on
me
which
only
causes
me
to
withdraw
back
into
my
comfort
zone
i
used
to
think
i
was
the
only
one
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
society
as
a
whole
has
spent
literally
thousands
of
years
admonishing
homosexuality
in
one
way
or
another
and
to
think
that
a
people
can
just
wake
up
one
morning
and
be
100
we
love
gays
after
just
a
few
decades
of
progressive
movements
reality
shows
and
pride
parades
seems
implausible
like
any
evolution
there
has
to
be
a
transition
perhaps
i
represent
that
transition
is
that
wrong
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
my
upbringing
has
instilled
me
with
a
certain
bias
while
i
know
better
now
and
have
made
great
strides
to
overcome
such
a
silly
predisposition
it's
difficult
for
me
to
completely
erase
this
vestigial
bias
and
i
just
wonder
will
i
ever
furthermore
i
wonder
if
the
feeling
of
discomfort
i
get
around
gays
isn't
caused
by
them
directly
but
rather
the
dissonance
experienced
as
my
mind
tries
to
wipe
out
my
senseless
vestigial
prejudice
before
you
point
fingers
though
ask
yourself
are
you
100
comfortable
around
all
kinds
of
people
and
walks
of
life
accepting
and
tolerant
sure
but
what
about
comfortable
then
again
so
long
as
you
support
people's
rights
and
causes
does
you
being
comfortable
even
matter
or
is
comfort
a
level
of
acceptance
that's
unnecessary
it
may
not
matter
on
a
societal
level
but
i'm
trying
to
be
the
best
person
i
can
be
so
i
guess
on
a
personal
level
to
me
it
does
in
any
case
while
it
may
be
too
late
for
me
i'll
be
sure
to
avoid
instilling
such
bias
in
my
own
children
so
they
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
same
foolish
discord
why
is
it
that
black
girls
don't
shave
especially
their
armpits
4461
would
germs
even
work
in
virginia
or
is
the
university
just
gonna
let
people
in
the
satellite
campus
die
of
alcohol
poisoning
if
they
really
are
shipping
all
the
minorities
over
there
for
cheap
housing
does
that
make
them
a
new
level
of
racist
4380
i
have
no
problems
or
issues
at
all
with
the
lgbtq
community
yet
due
to
force
of
habit
and
peer
conditioning
several
derogatory
words
have
become
part
of
my
vocabulary
i
don't
mean
anything
negative
when
i
use
these
words
i
don't
even
associate
them
with
a
person's
sexual
orientation
anymore
but
i
still
feel
bad
whenever
i
use
it
because
i
know
someone
else
perceives
it
differently
and
may
feel
hurt
by
it
i
don't
know
what
to
do
how
does
someone
forget
a
word
from
their
vocabulary
i
don't
even
consciously
use
it
sometimes
it
just
slips
out
jokingly
on
its
own
if
a
random
guy
takes
a
picture
of
a
girl
the
girl
will
think
that
is
weird
now
why
should
a
girl
be
able
to
take
a
picture
of
me
a
friend
told
me
that
a
short
fat
hispanic
girl
took
a
picture
of
me
and
then
uploaded
to
some
social
website
she
then
mentioned
that
she
loved
my
boots
and
then
some
other
fat
black
girl
commented
that
she
did
too
and
my
uniform
too
boot
chasers
these
days
but
if
a
guy
had
done
the
same
then
all
hell
would
break
lose
if
i
ever
see
this
girl
taking
a
picture
of
me
i
will
really
confront
her
and
ask
her
to
delete
it
you
know
how
it
is
right
ladies
you
know
a
guy
for
a
while
you
hang
out
with
him
you
do
fun
things
with
himplay
video
games
watch
movies
go
hiking
go
to
concerts
you
invite
him
to
your
parties
you
listen
to
his
problems
you
do
all
this
because
you
think
he
wants
to
be
your
friend
but
then
then
comes
the
fateful
moment
where
you
find
out
that
all
this
time
hes
only
seen
you
as
a
potential
girlfriend
and
then
if
you
turn
him
down
he
may
never
speak
to
you
again
this
has
happened
to
me
time
after
time
i
hit
it
off
with
a
guy
and
for
all
that
ive
been
burned
in
the
past
i
start
to
think
that
this
one
might
actually
care
about
me
as
a
person
and
then
he
asks
me
on
a
date
i
tell
him
how
much
i
enjoy
his
company
how
much
i
value
his
friendship
i
tell
him
that
i
really
want
to
be
his
friend
and
to
continue
hanging
out
with
him
and
talking
about
our
favorite
books
or
exploring
new
restaurants
or
making
fun
of
avant
garde
theatre
productions
but
he
rejects
me
he
doesnt
answer
my
calls
or
e
mails
if
wed
been
making
plans
to
do
something
before
this
fateful
incident
these
plans
mysteriously
fail
to
materialize
this
is
why
i
never
did
get
around
to
seeing
the
hunger
games
movie
not
to
name
any
names
but
thanks
a
lot
tom
later
when
i
run
into
him
at
social
events
our
conversations
are
awkward
and
lukewarm
this
is
because
the
moment
we
met
he
put
me
in
the
girlfriend
zone
and
now
he
cant
see
me
as
friend
material
i
must
say
that
i
find
this
really
unfair
i
mean
im
a
nice
girl
i
have
a
lot
to
offer
as
a
friend
like
not
being
a
douchebag
and
stuff
but
males
just
dont
want
to
be
friends
with
nice
girls
like
me
they
cant
help
it
i
guess
its
just
how
theyre
wired
biologically
evolution
conditioned
our
male
hominid
ancestors
to
seek
nice
girls
as
mates
and
form
friendship
bonds
only
with
the
other
dudes
that
they
hunted
mammoths
with
its
truei
know
this
because
i
studied
hominids
in
my
fifth
grade
science
class
so
whats
the
answer
should
i
take
up
mammoth
hunting
in
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
friendship
centers
of
mens
primal
lizardbrains
should
i
keep
making
guy
friends
and
then
prevent
them
from
making
a
move
on
me
by
subtly
undermining
their
self
confidence
should
i
just
give
up
on
those
manipulative
game
playing
two
faced
bastards
once
and
for
all
i
dont
know
i
mean
id
really
like
to
have
a
true
friendship
with
a
guy
someday
but
its
so
hard
to
trust
and
respect
them
when
they
never
say
what
they
meanand
you
never
know
when
you
might
be
relegated
to
the
girlfriend
zone

stop
pushing
your
agenda
onto
everything
please
stop
it's
rather
getting
annoying
i'm
sure
most
you
can
look
up
or
already
know
the
history
about
st
patrick
and
how
march
17
is
set
aside
as
a
christian
feast
day
to
honor
him
nowadays
it
has
changed
into
another
event
to
get
together
and
drink
haha
not
arguing
with
this
st
paddy's
day
is
about
celebrating
your
irish
heritage
and
doing
irish
things
not
everything
under
the
sun
has
to
have
your
type
of
representation
if
you
want
to
join
in
on
the
festivities
and
celebrate
st
paddy's
day
with
us
i
won't
have
any
complaints
i'll
even
buy
you
a
pint
you
know
spread
the
joy
around
and
celebrate
now
don't
get
me
wrong
everyone
deserves
to
have
equal
representation
and
movements
to
gain
support
but
when
you
start
mixing
events
together
they
no
longer
become
distinct
and
or
important
it's
like
that
old
saying
don't
put
licorice
in
your
hamburger
alright
here's
something
i'll
make
a
promise
to
the
lbtq
community
i
will
stop
complaining
about
your
representations
in
public
when
you
equally
affect
all
non

white

seemed

though
when
you
do

i'll
shut

then
i
will
be
a

to

also
if

a
friend
of
mine
tonight
explained
his
reasoning
to
why
illegal
immigrants
are
worthless
people
and
it
made
me
so
angry
because
i
can
only
imagine
how
hard
some
people
work
at
making
their
lives
better
or
their
children's
lives
filled
with
more
opportunity
he
brought
it
down
to
a
basic
principal
which
was
the
idea
that
it
was
illegal
for
them
to
be
here
yet
he
illegally
brought
me
over
a
bottle
of
wine
so
shouldn't
he
be
punished
too

hi
guys
i
need
some
help
here
i'm
debating
about
whether
to
become
a
christian
or
a
muslim
which
religion
is
more
lenient
in
terms
of
allowing
passage
into
heaven
paradise
allowing
forgiving
having
numerous
sexual
partners
before
marriage
is
a
key
point
for
me
also
can
anyone
comment
on
the
key
differences
between
heaven
and
paradise
which
one
would
a
guy
enjoy
more
thanks
for
your
help
i'll
make
a
decision
soon

christ
but
still
support
gays
who
live
in
sin
condoms

other
sinful
things
and
twist
the
words
of
jesus
around
to
support
their
liberal
agendas
like
that
jesus
would
want
people
on
food
stamps
and
bull
hockey
like
that
the
only
way
to
spot
a
true
christian
is
to
find
the
outspoken
ones
who
are
not
scared
to
preach
the
words
of
the
lord
i
just
want
to
find
a
good
christian
country
girl
who
is
outspoken
and
pretty
and
not
already
taken
it
that
so
hard
i
understand
the
errors
in
generalizing
but
i
can't
help
but
notice
that
on
most
days
i
go
on
a
run
someone
yells
something
usually
obscene
but
sometimes
it's
just
yelling
from
a
car
and
that
the
person
is
always
a
hispanic
male
i
hate
that
i
even
observe
the
race
but
i
do
and
i
can
attest
that
it
is
always
hispanic
i
know
plenty
of
wonderful
wholesome
kind
hispanic
people
who
would
never
do
this
but
still
why
does
this
always
happen
i
want
to
excuse
the
behavior
somehow
or
tell
myself
that
i
should
be
cursing
the
action
and
not
the
race
of
person
doing
yelling
and
yet
here
i
am
anonymously
ranting
on
my
liberal
arts
college's
confessions
page
about
my
closeted
racism
15375
to
my
pakistani
best
friend
we
do
everything
together
i've
had
some
of
the
best
times
in
my
life
in
your
company
yet
at
a
level
my
heart
doesn't
seem
to
trust
that
you
trust
me
the
way
it
should
naturally
too
much
of
a
baggage
of
history
from
our
grandparent's
parents
side
i
imagine
our
nationalities
have
created
this
imaginary
border
which
neither
of
us
can
seem
to
cross
at
a
deeper
level
i
hate
borders
and
nationalism
17832
i
am
a
gay
freshman
girl
and
i
want
to
go
to
some
lgbt
parties
how
do
i
get
invited
find
out
about
them
mitra
ghaffari
do
you
date
different
races
11308
so
i
went
to
becker
house
today
to
check
up
on
my
friend
and
i
saw
the
girl
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
all
this
while
she
was
sitting
in
the
computer
room
near
the
dinning
room
she
has
an
afro
she
is
black
i
remember
she
said
email
me
so
i
was
deciding
whether
to
go
reveal
myself
but
i
am
not
sure
she
likes
white
people
like
myself
she
doesnt
come
off
that
way
to
me
i
was
scared
so
i
walked
away
i
guess
i
am
a
punk
after
alllol
you
black
girl
with
the
afro
living
at
becker
house
3rd
floor
i
still
await
the
day
you
will
knock
on
my
door
and
just
say
hello
i
heard
you
going
to
harvard
goodluck
there
jesus
taught
tolerance
god
is
depicted
as
an
omniscient
all
perfect
being
man
wrote
the
bible
from
the
word
of
god
isn't
it
possible
we
didn't
get
the
message
100
clear
when
we
said
let's
hate
the
gays
and
they
will
burn
in
hell
i
don't
like
interracial
porn
black
guys
take
me
out
of
the
mood
does
that
make
me
racist
with
this
new
lgbt
ceremony
going
on
i
feel
discriminated
against
why
do
these
students
deserve
recognition
based
on
thier
sexual
preference
we
should
have
a
hetero
sexual
banquet
celebrating
the
achievements
of
our
straight
student
body
we
not
we
have
already
established
precident
how
about
celebrating
our
white
students
for
being
born
into
the
caucasian
variety
there
are
tons
of
great
things
about
a
m
and
about
texas
in
general
but
as
soon
as
i
graduate
i'm
gonna
have
to
flee
to
a
state
and
an
area
that
doesn't
have
to
be
dragged
kicking
and
screaming
into
modernity
and
if
this
school
didn't
have
so
many
backwards
people
straight
resource
center
and
the
student
senate
bill
to
opt
out
of
about
50
cents
worth
of
fees
that
goes
to
help
an
oppressed
minority
anyone
not
to
mention
the
numerous
creationists
i've
met
it
would
be
absolutely
amazing
as
it
is
i
kind
of
wish
i
had
gone
somewhere
else
you
don't
want
me
shoving
my
religion
in
your
face
don't
shove
your
homosexuality
in
mine
i
think
it's
wrong
it's
your
right
to
make
that
choice
but
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
it
biologically
it
does
nothing
for
our
species
the
physical
act
of
sodomy
is
horrendously
disgusting
if
you
take
2
seconds
to
think
about
it
objectively
and
that
sort
of
lifestyle
leads
to
a
very
high
incidence
of
stds
no
amount
of
propaganda
marches
or
lgbt
centers
can
change
this
do
what
you
want
but
quit
trying
to
force
me
to
accept
it
one
man
one
woman
that
is
clearly
the
way
that
god
or
nature
intended
it
that's
the
pillar
of
the
survival
of
our
species
the
creation
of
life
so
that's
what
i'll
support
and
one
more
question
for
gay
marriage
supporters
before
i
go
if
10
consenting
people
all
love
each
other
and
consent
to
marry
do
you
support
their
right
to
all
marry
each
other
if
not
why
not
who
are
you
to
tell
these
ten
people
what
they
can
do
with
their
lives
to
deny
them
their
rights
what
about
20
people
30
turns
out
we
all
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
just
draw
it
where
nature
put
it
i
am
an
egyptian
guy
and
i
am
having
a
hard
time
meeting
girls
that
are
interested
in
me
is
it
because
of
my
race
or
am
i
not
being
open
enough
this
happens
in
general
with
making
white
friends
nothing
against
minorities
i
just
feel
like
texas
a
m
is
split
between
whites
and
non
whites
maybe
all
the
recent
queer
talk
is
getting
to
my
head
but
i
feel
like
you've
given
me
odd
looks
as
we
pass
each
other
to
from
worner
are
you
interested
or
avoiding
i'm
not
totally
out
either
if
you
are
interested
which
also
goes
for
it
you're
not
2644
being
of
mixed
race
race
itself
has
never
been
an
indicator
of
attractiveness
to
me
and
all
my
life
i've
dated
guys
of
different
races
i
am
mixed
but
i
appear
more
black
than
anything
and
since
coming
here
i
seem
to
only
attract
black
guys
which
is
fine
and
everything
but
is
that
my
only
option
are
non
black
cornell
guys
generally
not
attracted
to
black
girls
or
something
i
don't
get
it
so
there's
a
guy
i
would
like
to
go
to
midnight
yell
with
should
i
go
ahead
and
ask
him
or
are
girls
not
supposed
to
ask
guys
8303
i
love
to
sing
and
would
want
to
be
apart
of
a
black
male
a
capella
group
however
i
can't
find
one
on
campus
is
anyone
else
interested
or
know
people
who
are
interested
in
making
one
the
people
who
support
gay
marriage
stating
that
we
should
not
impose
our
personal
beliefs
on
other
people
are
the
same
people
opposing
polygamy
if
gay
marriage
becomes
legal
why
make
polygamy
illegal
what
gives
you
the
right
to
tell
people
they
cannot
practice
polygamy
then
2711
the
outspoken
feminist
in
my
writing
class
is
so
zealous
about
cataloging
the
ways
men
have
wronged
women
that
i
actually
don't
care
anymore
not
that
i
think
she's
wrong
about
the
patriarchy
rape
culture
etc
quite
the
opposite
it's
just
that
she's
so
relentless
and
heavy
handed
that
it
makes
me
want
to
break
up
with
my
girlfriend
and
never
talk
to
another
woman
again
let
alone
work
towards
equal
rights
is
it
too
much
to
ask
that
feminists
find
a
way
of
making
it
fun
to
care
about
what
they
say
right
or
wrong
you
catch
more
flies
with
honey
than
vinegar
3894
i'm
really
attracted
to
athletic
guys
but
are
white
guys
not
attracted
to
asian
girls
why
do
a
lot
of
black
people
type
like
this
everyone
plays
an
important
role
in
society
which
is
why
we
joke
about
one
another
but
why
is
it
we
can
say
jokes
about
everyone
but
people
flip
shit
about
when
someone
says
a
black
one
for
example
people
laugh
at
the
joke
of
two
jews
went
to
camp
auschwitz
or
white
guys
and
their
compensating
trucks
perhaps
one
of
the
mexicans
stealing
the
green
cards
from
uno
or
asians
as
bad
drivers
or
how
about
the
arabs
blowing
things
up
and
the
indians
thanking
us
for
coming
again
even
the
natives
get
their
daily
dose
but
we
rarely
hear
a
response
since
whites
killed
most
now
for
the
rustling
of
the
gimmies
part
if
someone
says
or
even
hits
at
something
remotly
close
to
a
stereotype
you're
a
racist
when
it
comes
to
blacks
black
people
like
fried
chicken
racist
the
fuck
i
was
merely
getting
some
stats
for
a
class
i'm
now
a
racist
for
stating
that
a
bussiness
can
thank
a
demographic
for
being
prosperous
if
blacks
did
not
exist
churches
would
be
bankrupt
16543
im
white
and
i
want
a
black
guy
my
roommates
asian
and
she
wants
a
white
guy
i
guess
cornell
is
working
its
magic
4455
i
think
that
nyu's
gender
ratio
needs
to
be
recalculated
how
can
it
be
60
40
female
to
male
if
i'm
the
only
guy
in
a
class
of
30
people
honestly
if
people
would
shut
the
hell
up
about
racism
it
would
disappear
or
at
least
get
scaled
down
a
whole
lot
more
than
it
already
is
and
to
all
the
minorities
that
say
you
don't
get
equal
treatment
or
opportunity's
you're
full
of
shit
i
guarantee
you
can
get
all
the
same
jobs
i
can
if
you
actually
present
yourself
professionally
and
actually
pursue
something
and
strive
for
it
instead
of
using
the
sorry
excuse
im
a
minority
so
why
try
because
the
white
person
is
going
to
get
it
over
me
also
minorities
get
far
more
scholarship
opportunities
than
a
middle
class
white
male
will
ever
get
i
guarantee
minorities
qualify
for
all
the
scholarships
i
do
but
do
i
qualify
for
all
of
the
ones
they
do
no
so
just
shut
the
hell
up
about
racism
and
all
the
discrimination
you
receive
3586
i
am
hesitating
to
make
a
move
because
i
am
not
sure
if
this
boy
is
straight
he
just
takes
such
a
good
care
of
himself
but
who
is
to
say
that
straight
guys
don't
know
how
to
dress
right
17293
are
you
saying
we
shouldn't
judge
people
for
being
racist
that
is
extremely
stupid
there
is
an
obvious
difference
between
criticizing
someone
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin
and
criticizing
them
for
the
choice
to
hate
an
entire
group
of
people
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin
if
you
can't
see
it
i
wonder
how
you
even
got
into
this
school
1688
what's
a
black
guy
have
to
do
to
hook
up
with
a
cute
snow
bunny
i'm
a
cis
girl
i'm
attracted
to
trans
men
sometimes
i
want
a
penis
sometimes
i
don't
but
i
like
men
and
don't
want
to
be
one
what's
up
with
that
pretty
frustrated
i'm
pretty
sure
i'm
going
to
jail
for
illegal
online
activity
i
looked
up
trans
operations
out
of
curiosity
and
got
a
message
that
says
it
was
actually
not
an
adult
why
aren't
there
safe
sites
to
view
if
you're
curious
about
transitioning
here's
a
confession
that
will
make
a
bunch
of
people
mad
i
have
a
problem
with
black
people
getting
offended
when
people
call
them
black
just
because
you
have
dark
skin
color
doesn't
mean
you're
african
america
that
would
mean
that
either
you
your
parent
s
and
or
grandparent
s
came
directly
from
africa
you
don't
see
black
people
in
england
calling
themselves
african
englishmen
plus
why
is
perfectly
fine
for
all
caucasians
to
be
called
white
whether
they
came
from
england
france
australia
or
even
right
here
in
america
they
are
still
just
considered
to
be
white
i
was
born
in
russia
and
i
will
never
be
asked
to
be
called
a
russian
american
by
blood
i'm
russian
but
by
how
i
live
i'm
an
american
i
don't
need
anyone
giving
me
a
title
that
reminds
me
i'm
american
the
only
group
that
i'm
okay
with
gaining
the
title
american
as
their
race
are
the
native
americans
because
after
all
they
never
left
this
land
for
those
who
call
me
a
racist
the
first
best
friends
i
had
were
black
and
i
think
racist
people
are
some
of
the
stupidest
people
on
earth
demanding
to
be
referred
as
an
african
american
is
using
the
race
card
and
i
have
little
respect
for
people
who
try
to
use
race
to
prove
their
point
whites
are
not
superior
because
they
are
white
nor
should
blacks
get
special
treatment
because
they
are
black
whether
you're
black
white
green
or
purple
you
are
human
and
you
gain
my
full
respect
for
the
fact
that
you're
human
right
now
i
live
in
america
and
know
i'm
an
american
you
can
call
me
what
ever
you
want
but
it
doesn't
change
who
i
am
i
live
by
a
set
of
principles
that
i
always
follow
and
in
the
end
everyone
is
equal
in
the
eyes
of
god
that
goes
for
my
god
and
the
other
gods
because
i'm
sure
none
of
them
are
racist
that's
my
confession
if
you
call
it
a
confession
just
sayin
17283
can
all
of
the
minorities
stop
saying
that
they
hate
people
who
don't
adhere
to
their
stereotype
so
can
we
just
stop
using
terms
like
white
acting
and
straight
acting
i'm
looking
at
you
i
hate
white
tinos
and
i
hate
white
acting
black
guys
same
goes
for
the
queer
community
touting
the
term
straight
acting
you
go
to
cornell
an
ivy
league
university
you
should
be
smart
enough
to
not
expect
people
to
act
like
stereotypes
and
smart
enough
to
not
be
angry
at
them
for
not
being
a
predictable
clich
what
the
darn
diddily
doodily
did
you
just
say
about
me
you
little
witcharooney
ill

about
to
bring
down
upon

from
the
heavens
maybe
you

looking
for
a
christian
girlfriend
and
i'm
having
a
hard
time
accepting
god's
timing
is
it
bad
that
i
want
a
solid
relationship
right
now
5778
after
rangila
i
realized
i
have
brown
fever
sharang
are
you
into
the
swirl
because
i
want
you
in
me
why
are
superheroes
always
white
why
can't
they
be
black
white
hispanic
asian
and
maybe
even
have
different
sexual
orientation
in
there
too
i'm
not
a
religious
guy
but
i
find
it
quite
stupid
when
a
dumb
sluts
put
up
pictures
statuses
tweets
of
them
quoting
the
bible
and
saying
god
is
good
when
in
reality
they've
done
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
bible
says
i
don't
know
maybe
it's
just
me
3893
why
are
there
no
asians
in
top
frats
on
campus
are
they
just
racist
im
looking
for
one
sig
pi
doesnt
count
y'all
want
to
hear
a
joke
woman's
rights
dear
white
people
listening
to
you
cry
about
how
oppressed
you
are
makes
me
laugh
extra
hard
you're
like
dead
last
in
this
country
behind
japanese
mexican
immigrants
native
americans
arabs
and
blacks
i
seriously
can't
believe
it
when
you
guys
bitch
and
moan
about
how
it's
so
hard
to
be
white
and
how
those
minorities
get
all
the
benefits
take
that
fleeting
feeling
of
being
ostracized
and
cry
about
it
bitch
you
just
experienced
a
small
slice
of
my
life
sucks
right
what
do
insert
race
here
insert
sex
here
think
about
insert
race
here
insert
sex
here
to
the
person
who
said
they
value
women
no
you
only
value
your
idea
of
what
you
think
a
woman
should
be
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
about
getting
married
god
designed
women
to
get
married
and
raise
a
family
to
get
to
heaven
that's
huge
job
that
is
the
ultimate
job
god
made
for
women
it's
also
a
humble
job
because
women
are
to
serve
their
families
like
jesus
also
jesus
says
the
servant
is
the
greatest
among
men
god
himself
designed
a
perfect
plan
how
then
can
we
tell
him
it's
not
good
enough
let's
take
a
minute
to
rest
from
our
constant
bickering
of
political
parties
ignore
my
grammar
and
spelling
since
submitting
this
on
a
phone
was
not
the
easiest
with
that
said
gather
around
ags
i
have
a
story
to
tell
i
remember
when
i
was
in
middle
school
they
were
interviewing
iraqis
on
the
civil
war
or
the
first
elections
i
cannot
remember
and
where
they
the
iraqis
where
they
stood
on
the
conflict
the
american
reporter
asked
whether
he
was
a
sunni
or
shi'ite
sorry
if
i
misspelled
it
the
gentleman
responded
i'm
an
iraqi
looking
back
to
this
now
it
brought
a
chill
down
my
spine
this
guy
understood
what
democracy
was
about
sure
they
argued
but
whether
they
know
it
or
not
the
only
thing
they
can
rely
on
is
each
other
we
can
learn
from
those
who
we
have
taught
so
we
can
realize
how
far
we've
strayed
we
are
all
americans
why
can
we
not
start
acting
like
it
10135
a
while
ago
i
yelled
at
a
bunch
of
girls
for
being
very
loud
on
a
late
school
night
i
apologized
after
doing
so
but
since
then
some
of
the
girls
have
been
acting
very
friendly
towards
me
i
know
they
are
not
acting
this
way
because
they
are
being
friendly
but
i
think
it's
more
of
sort
of
a
passive
aggressive
behavior
to
see
what
i'm
all
about
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
has
happened
where
someone
whom
i
have
wronged
has
started
being
friendly
towards
me
and
i
notice
that
it
is
white
people
who
do
this
i've
tried
and
cannot
figure
out
the
motivation
for
this
why
would
you
try
to
talk
to
the
person
who
has
wronged
you
especially
in
such
an
over
friendly
way
can
anyone
please
give
some
insight
into
this
16206
do
girls
at
cornell
find
guys
who
aren't
white
to
be
sexy
attractive
boyfriend
material
if
so
then
why
doesn't
it
seem
apparent
like
i
don't
see
much
interracial
relationships
especially
between
blacks
and
whites
asians
and
blacks
that
very
awkward
moment
when
your
friend
becomes
born
again
christian
and
gets
a
new
boyfriend
but
instead
of
transforming
she
starts
acting
giving
you
one
word
closed
responses
blowing
you
off
and
rolling
her
eyes
at
you
when
she
thought
you
were
not
looking
i
am
a
believer
and
try
to
live
right
but
i
am
not
a
missionary
nor
do
i
post
bible
verses
on
fb
but
what
the
hell
did
i
do
to
deserve
all
that
to
make
myself
clear
i
do
not
hate
homosexuals
and
anybody
who
acts
violently
toward
them
is
committing
a
graver
sin
than
the
homosexuals
themselves
there
are
several
admitted
homosexuals
in
my
congregation
most
churches
forbid
homosexuals
to
worship
but
we
worked
out
a
deal
with
the
four
men
and
two
women
who
engage
in
homosexual
acts
they
are
deathly
afraid
of
the
hellfire
that
awaits
them
in
the
next
life
so
we
arranged
to
have
them
sit
behind
a
curtain
while
the
church
is
in
session
some
of
the
older
people
are
not
comfortable
so
the
homosexuals
must
leave
though
the
back
of
the
church
every
sunday
we
have
an
hour
of
praying
away
the
gay
so
that
these
people
will
be
able
to
hopefully
cure
their
sinful
disease
and
live
righteously
we
usually
sing
hymns
and
read
scripture
that
guides
them
away
from
their
disgusting
acts
one
of
the
lesbians
has
not
been
with
another
woman
in
two
years
at
least
we've
had
one
success
i
firmly
believe
that
this
is
the
way
that
we
should
deal
with
the
homosexual
problem
in
our
society
progressively
some
churches
simply
banish
those
people
and
do
not
allow
them
to
partake
in
worship
how
does
that
cure
the
problem
i
suggest
more
churches
embrace
homosexuals
like
we
do
and
help
them
overcome
their
disability
15280
the
world
should
not
come
to
accepting
homosexuality
as
a
norm
in
society
i
wish
people
would
stop
treating
it
as
a
civil
rights
issue
no
one
is
born
gay
there
is
no
gay
gene
there
are
certain
incidents
in
one's
life
that
may
push
him
her
to
question
their
sexual
orientation
be
it
a
rough
childhood
or
whatever
it
is
we
were
made
to
procreate
it
is
only
right
and
homosexuality
is
unnatural
no
one
can
dispute
that
for
those
of
you
who
are
unaware
homosexuality
is
how
aids
came
to
be
people
can
say
why
does
it
bother
you
if
they
don't
bother
you
leave
it
alone
and
its
none
of
your
business
well
it
is
my
business
because
i
don't
want
to
be
a
member
of
a
society
where
health
issues
in
the
future
may
become
rampant
because
of
our
open
mindedness
also
if
they
function
as
a
progressive
member
of
society
and
are
productive
and
contributing
to
our
well
being
why
does
it
matter
if
they're
gay
it
matters
because
it
is
a
health
issue
i
think
homosexuality
is
a
psychological
issue
and
just
like
all
others
it
can
be
cured
it
destroys
how
families
are
supposed
to
be
structured
homosexual
activists
attempt
to
portray
their
lifestyles
as
normal
and
healthy
hollywood
and
the
media
relentlessly
propagate
the
image
of
the
fit
healthy
and
well
adjusted
homosexual
while
the
reality
is
quite
the
opposite
instability
and
promiscuity
typically
characterize
homosexual
relationships
these
two
factors
increase
the
incidence
of
serious
and
incurable
stds
please
stop
giving
these
activists
carte
blanche
it
is
unnatural
and
unhygienic
admin
quit
being
a
butt
gonorrhea
and
herpes
cold
sores
are
uncurable
stds
and
straights
pass
them
all
over
the
place
and
if
homosexuality
is
curable
why
isn't
homophobia
and
your
obnoxious
misplaced
concern
for
lifestyles
that
need
less
than
none
of
your
input
15273
i
am
gay
and
i
have
to
admit
when
i
was
first
coming
to
terms
with
myself
i
realized
i
was
not
100
comfortable
with
gay
culture
and
people
i
felt
incredibly
out
of
place
because
i
knew
i
was
gay
but
i
wasn't
comfortable
with
other
gays
i
had
a
plethora
of
prejudices
about
the
people
who
shared
my
sexuality
i
thought
i'd
never
date
a
guy
who
was
feminine
i
swore
to
myself
that
i'd
break
the
gay
mold
and
be
a
jock
that
was
awesome
at
whatever
sport
he
did
i'd
chill
with
the
bros
love
football
and
be
quite
indifferent
to
all
the
gay
hullabaloo
i
wanted
everyone
to
see
and
know
that
gay
wasn't
all
that
bad
i
wanted
people
to
see
that
gay
could
be
normal
i
thought
i
was
purporting
a
better
image
for
the
average
gay
male
but
it
hit
me
one
day
i
was
just
as
worse
as
the
right
most
republican
condemning
any
gay
lifestyle
i
was
so
uncomfortable
with
myself
that
i
was
doing
everything
i
could
to
fit
my
sexuality
in
a
hetero
mold
that
the
vast
majority
of
society
would
find
acceptable
i
tried
to
suppress
every
thought
and
action
that
was
too
gay
so
that
people
would
find
me
more
acceptable
well
truth
is
i'm
not
hetero
and
i
shouldn't
be
trying
to
force
my
sexuality
into
a
manner
that
appeases
the
masses
gay
is
gay
whether
someone
is
stereotypical
gay
or
an
unconventional
gay
what
does
it
matter
all
hetero
people
are
not
the
same
why
should
gays
be
and
who
am
i
to
judge
who
is
anyone
to
judge
every
single
person
is
different
and
gay
is
just
one
innate
characteristic
of
billions
i
guess
my
point
is
no
matter
if
you're
gay
or
straight
acceptance
isn't
always
something
we're
born
with
so
if
someone
admits
they're
uncomfortable
around
any
walk
of
life
it
doesn't
immediately
mean
they're
a
bigot
people
need
time
and
exposure
to
foster
understanding
even
us
gays
who
most
would
assume
are
naturally
accepting
of
all
races
as
long
as
we
make
strides
to
reach
a
sense
of
solidarity
it
means
our
hearts
are
sincere
sometimes
people
need
time
is
all
so
don't
go
shouting
suppression
and
injustice
if
someone
doesn't
catch
on
right
away
instead
try
to
ease
they're
discomfort
show
them
you're
a
person
as
well
and
our
differences
are
what
makes
a
unique
beauty
because
condemnation
will
get
us
nowhere
where
the
cute
gay
boys
at
1080
i
gotta
confess
nate
tisa
makes
me
wish
i
was
a
gay
man
can
i
at
least
be
your
beard
when
you're
ready
to
settle
down
i
would
cook
you
dinner
and
be
your
perfect
little
housewife
and
you
could
still
fuck
the
sexy
latino
pool
boy
even
though
i'm
a
christian
i
support
laws
allowing
gay
marriage
in
the
united
states
while
the
bible
condemns
homosexuality
as
a
sin
we
live
in
a
nation
that
bases
itself
on
freedom
of
religion
and
the
right
to
pursue
happiness.god
gave
man
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
follow
christ
as
the
lord
and
savior
so
why
should
man
try
to
deny
the
choice
of
homosexuality
for
others
